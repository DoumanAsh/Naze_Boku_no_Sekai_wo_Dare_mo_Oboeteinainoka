_TL Note:_ Hokora is a mini shinto shrine.

The green labyrinth [Ciel Mir Forest] - was a natural maze, with many trees, towering over the place, being lined up in disarray.
With cover of their thick and dense leaves, only handful of light being able to pass through.

They walked over muddy leaf mould.
Leaves, blown by wind, were shaking and rustling with a pleasant sound.
The serenity of this land was likely undisturbed for hundred years
And now that...

"Kai, cannot thee run it more silently?
This thing, thee call a car, is just too noisy.
It spoils the forest's serenity."

"I'm already doing my best here, you know?"

He already lost count of how many times Reiren, who was sitting besides him on passenger seat cross-legged, complained.

"It might not seem like that, but we got low noise tires so it is actually quite silent ride.
I already explained, but behind us we got 30 cars lined up."

"...Good grief."

"By the way, this road is quite thin..."

"Indeed so, but it shall not become any more thinner though, so these cars shall be able to pass."

Shrine maiden pointed in front of a front window.
With Reiren showing them the way, Urza Resistance Army, led by Jeanne, was crossing the unmapped forest.
...The largest forest in the world.

While looking up a great tree, that was completely filling the sight before them, 28 military cars were passing through.
And Kai was driving the car, that was leading them.
He was driving in accordance with Reiren's guidence, who was sitting on passenger seat,
and following from behind was regiment of vehicles.

_TL Note:_ There are two confusing points: First it was 30 but then 28?
Another thing is that here author also uses `車両` which is rather translated as railway transport.

"Kai, turn to the right here."

With these words, all of the sudden Reiren directed him to the right.

"Here?"

"We just passed by it would seems."

"Couldn't you tell me 5 seconds earlier!?"

He quickly steered the wheel.
Towards the road, entangled by roots of the ancient tree.
Because of the roots, the road was uneven and it also obscured their field of vision.
But what helped them is that this road was as wide as the main road.

"This time it is quite wide road, but..."

"Atractylodes purine passed here.
Look at these trees with their barks being peeled off.
These are marks left by Atractylodes purine."

_TL Note:_ wtf is `オケラチュチュプリン`

"Atractylodes...?"

"It is huge hedgehog.
When it becomes round, its diameter can be around 10 meters."

Reiren nonchalantly answered.

"It rarely appears, but when it comes rolling over car, there will be nothing left."

"Wait a sec...!?"

"Hey, wait a second!?"

From their back seats on left and right, Resistance soldiers Saki and Ashlan shouted.
Up until now they remained completely bored, but now they reached out in confusion.

"Wait, wait, Reiren-chan!? You're our expert on this elven forest, aren't you?
What are we going to do if this thing appears!"

"That's right, are you sure it is good idea to take this road!?"

"No need for worry."

Said the shrine maiden, who folded her arms with confidence.

"This forest is akin to my own garden.
It is fine, leave it to me."

She was their <span title="jp. 地質 is geology, but that's pretty much wrong term here and most likely it was supposed to be 地理">geographer</span>, Reiren.
Right now in addition to her seventh layered garments she wore white robe, and her long ears were hidden under the hair.
Her background was a researcher from Io Resistance, who was going to lend her hand -
This was how Jeanne explained her presence to soldiers like Saki and Ashlan.

"Mu..."

Rinne started sulking from her seat at the back.

"I cannot agree with this arrangement.
Why this elf.... I mean Reiren is sitting with Kai together and enjoying herself."

"I'm supposed to guide thee, am I not?
Humans maps have nothing on the forest after all."

Reiren glanced at the Rinne behind.

"Well, I'm more talented that thee after all."

"That's not true...! You... damn flat elf!"

"What's wrong with being flat!"

"Please, calm down, both of you."

The moment Rinne said the [elf] Kai was struck with utter terror, but it would seem neither Kai or Ashlan shown no sign of noticing it.

_TODO:_ `人類未開の森を突っ切っている最中で、それどころではないのだろう。` the second part is a bit weird, I don't get it? Need to try again

"Hey, Kai? I guess even you don't have map of this place?"

Asked Saki, with a gun under her arm.

"Since the true world and stuff like that, I thought you'd know everything."

"I'm not that knowledgable, you know? Besides..."

But he didn't finish his sentence.
Hearing it, the elf, who sat besides him, could receive unimaginable shock.
Thinking like that, these words stuck in his throat.

In the true world, Ciel Mir forest doesn't exist.

It was burned down completely.
During the Great War majority of the forest was burned in battles.
Moreover with disappearance of foreign gods, who was managing the forest, ecosystem became wrecked.

In the true world there was no longer any forest.

_TL Note_: When referring to Ciel Mir, sensei is using `樹海` which could be literally translated as sea of trees, but I use just `forest`

![Reiren and Rinne](./p043.jpg)

_Humanity's triumph in the Great War belongs to the true history._

_But it is not all that good. For example this forest._

The forest, that remained standing in this world, made Kai to feel conflicted.
For hundred of thousands species that were living in the largest in the world forest, rather than a world, where humanity won, the current world is much more desirable.

[All units, report: is everything in order?]

Jeanne radioed to all (cars) at once, from the cadillac, which was in the column's center.

[This forest has thousands of unknown to us animals and plants.
There are poisonous flowers meadows, and also butterflies that spread the poison.
Everyone be sure to report if you feel unwell or uncomfortable.]

"...Good grief, what a great commander."

Elven shrine maiden said, while folding her arms.
Commander Jeanne didn't end her communications with orders alone.
She would always end with words of appreciation for the work of her subordinates.
As she was likely spot the subtle anxiety.

As they were proceeding deeper into these unfamiliar lands...
If they'd lose their way, there would be no way to return.
She(Jeanne) understood the anxiety and fears of her subordinates, who were challenging such dangerous lands.

[Vanguard car, what is situation? Any changes?]

"Perfectly fine, as a matter of fact."

Reiren gave a prompt response.

"In first place, if the forest would be actually so dangerous, foreign gods wouldn't even approach it.
But oh well, thee can leave it to me.
Even I have no desire to get myself killed after all.
So I'm going to choose the safest route."

[Please do so.]

They could hear Jeanne's chuckle from radio.

[Want to check one thing.
Does this forest, Ciel Mir, goes all the way until Yurun in south?]

"Indeed so.
I also made a direct trip on foot.
At that time it took me around 7 days."

Even for elf, who was able to easily leap from branch to branch of the ancient tree, almost like flying, it took seven days.

It made him wonder just how big this maze of the forest was.
Hearing Reiren's answer astonished him.

[And with our current pace?]

"Ideally it should take us 3 days and 3 nights.
But along the way we should be able to find few fruits, edible by humans.
No need to worry about provisions."

[Understood. I suppose I should be thankful to the Dante for supplying us with brand new batteries.]

Io Resistance's base was at Cassiopeia, which was industrial city in past.

If it wouldn't be for plants that could supply their cars with new batteries, there would be no way for them to carry out their plan of traversing through this maze of the forest.

"With our current pace, we should be able to reach a stream, abundant with spring water, within 2 hours."

[So you heard her, my friends.
Our next break...]

"Kai, what is that thing?"

Rinne, who stretched her neck from the rear, pointed towards the front glass.

She was pointing towards the clearance between two ancient trees.
As it was still far away, it wasn't very clearly visible.

"Hm? Meaning?"

"There is something weird there.
Many trees are fallen down,
and even ground became messy."

"...What!?"
