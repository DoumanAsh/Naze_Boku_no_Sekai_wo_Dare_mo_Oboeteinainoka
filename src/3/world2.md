_TL Note:_ Hokora is a mini shinto shrine.

The green labyrinth [Ciel Mir Forest] - was a natural maze, with many trees, towering over the ground, being lined up in disarray.
Only a sparse amount of light could pass through the cover of densely growing leaves.

The ground was covered in muddy leaf mould.
Leaves blown by the wind were shaking and rustling with a pleasant sound.
The serenity of this land had likely been undisturbed for hundreds of years.
And now that...

"Kai, cannot thee run it more silently?
This thing thee call a car, is just too noisy.
It spoils the forest's serenity."

"I'm already doing my best here, you know?"

He had already lost count of how many times the Reiren sitting cross-legged complained from the passenger seat.

"It might not seem so, but our tires are low-noise. They are actually quite silent.
I explained it already, but we have around 30 cars lined up behind us."

"...Good grief."

"By the way, this road is quite narrow..."

"Indeed so. It shall not become any more narrower though, so these cars shall be able to pass."

The shrine maiden pointed towards the front window.
With Reiren showing them the way, the Urza Resistance Army, led by Jeanne, was crossing the unmapped forest.
...The largest forest in the world.

While looking up towards great trees completely filling their field of vision, 28 military cars were moving forward.
And Kai was driving the car leading them.
He was following Reiren's guidance, who was sitting on passenger seat.
Behind them was the regiment of vehicles.

"Kai, turn to the right here."

With these words, all of a sudden Reiren directed him to the right.

"Here?"

"We just passed by, it would seem."

"Couldn't you tell me 5 seconds earlier!?"

He quickly steered the wheel.
Towards the road entangled by roots of the ancient tree.
Because of the roots, the road was uneven, and their field of vision was also obscured.
But what helped them was that the road was as wide as the main road.

"This time it is quite a wide road, but..."

"An atractylodes purine has passed through here.
Look at these trees with their barks being peeled off.
These are the marks left by Atractylodes purine."

_TL Note:_ wtf is `オケラチュチュプリン`

"Atractylodes...?"

"It is massive hedgehog.
When it becomes round, its diameter can be around 10 meters."

Reiren nonchalantly answered.

"It rarely appears, but if it comes rolling over the car, there will be nothing left."

"Wait a sec...!?"

"Hey, wait a second!?"

From their back seats on left and right, Resistance soldiers Saki and Ashlan shouted.
Up until now they were completely bored, but now they reached out in confusion.

"Wait, wait, Reiren-chan!? You're our expert on this Elven forest, right?
What are we going to do if this thing appears!"

"That's right, are you sure it's a good idea to take this road!?"

"No need for worry."

Said the shrine maiden, who folded her arms with confidence.

"This forest is akin to my own garden.
It is fine, leave it to me."

She was their <span title="jp. 地質 is geology, but that's pretty much wrong term here and most likely it was supposed to be 地理">geographer</span>, Reiren.
Right now in addition to her seven layered garments she wore a white robe, and her long ears were hidden under the hair.
Her background was a researcher from Io Resistance, who was going to lend her hand -
This was how Jeanne explained her presence to soldiers like Saki and Ashlan.

"Mu..."

Rinne was sulking from her seat at the back.

"I cannot agree with this arrangement.
Why this elf.... I mean Reiren, sitting together with Kai and enjoying herself?"

"I'm supposed to guide thee, am I not?
Human's maps have nothing on these woodlands after all."

Reiren glanced at Rinne behind.

"Well, I'm more talented than thee after all."

"That's not true...! You... damn flat elf!"

"What's wrong with being flat!"

"Please calm down, both of you."

The moment Rinne mentioned [elf] Kai was struck with utter terror, but it would seem neither Kai nor Ashlan showed signs of noticing it.
They were probably too busy to notice, while crossing forest unmapped by humans.

"Hey, Kai? I guess even you don't have a map of this place?"

Asked Saki, with a gun under her arm.

"Since you know about the true world and stuff, I thought you'd know everything."

"I'm not that knowledgeable, you know? Besides..."

But he didn't finish his sentence.
The elf who sat besides him could receive unimaginable shock if he had done so.
Thinking so, these words stuck in his throat.

In the true world, Ciel Mir forest doesn't exist.

It was burned down completely.
During the Great War majority of the forest was burned in battles.
Moreover, with the disappearance of the foreign gods who were managing the forest, the ecosystem had gotten wrecked.

In the true world there was no longer any forest.

_TL Note_: When referring to Ciel Mir, sensei is using `樹海` which could be literally translated as sea of trees, but I use just `forest`

![Reiren and Rinne](./p043.jpg)

_Humanity's triumph in the Great War belongs to the true history._

_But it is not all that good. For example this forest._

The forest, that remained flourishing in this world, made Kai to feel conflicted.
For the hundred of thousands species that were living in the largest forest in the world, the current world is much more desirable than one where humanity had won.

[All units, report: is everything in order?]

Jeanne radioed to all (cars) at once, from the cadillac, which was in the queue's center.

[This forest has thousands of animals and plants unknown to us.
There are poisonous flower meadows, and also butterflies that spread the poison.
Everyone, be sure to report if you feel unwell or uncomfortable.]

"...Good grief, what a great commander."

The elven shrine maiden said, while folding her arms.
Commander Jeanne never ended her communications with orders alone.
She would always end with words of appreciation for the work of her subordinates.
As she was probably attentive to these subtleties.

As they were proceeding deeper into the unfamiliar lands...
If they lost their way, it would be impossible to return.
She(Jeanne) understood the anxiety and fears of her subordinates, who were challenging such dangerous lands.

[Vanguard car, what is situation? Any changes?]

"Perfectly fine, as a matter of fact."

Reiren gave a prompt response.

"In the first place, if the forest were actually so dangerous, the foreign gods wouldn't even approach it.
But oh well, thee can leave it to me.
Even I have no desire to get myself killed after all.
So I'm going to choose the safest route."

[Please do so.]

They could hear Jeanne chuckle over the radio.

[Just want to check one thing.
Does this forest, Ciel Mir, go all the way until Yurun in the south?]

"Indeed so.
I had also made a direct trip on foot.
At that time it took me around 7 days."

Even for the elf, who was able to easily leap from branch to branch of the ancient trees, almost like flying, it took seven days.

It made him wonder just how big this maze of the forest was.
Hearing Reiren's answer astonished him.

[And at our current pace?]

"Ideally it should take us 3 days and 3 nights.
But along the way we should be able to find some fruits edible by humans.
No need to worry about provisions."

[Understood. I suppose we should be thankful to the Dante for supplying us with brand new batteries.]

Io Resistance's base was at Cassiopeia, which was an industrial city in the past.

If it weren't for plants that could supply their cars with new batteries, there would be no way for them to carry out their plan of traversing through this maze of a forest.

"At our current pace, we should be able to reach a stream abundant with spring water, within 2 hours."

[So you heard her, my friends.
Our next break...]

"Kai, what is that thing?"

Rinne, who stretched her neck from the rear, pointed towards the front glass.

She was pointing towards the clearance between two ancient trees.
As it was still far away, it wasn't very clearly visible.

"Hmm? Meaning?"

"There is something weird there.
Many trees have fallen down,
and even the ground is messy."

"...What!?"

Unintentionally, he put more force in his grip.
As they were running straight towards the direction Rinne pointed at, right then...

"Stop this thing!"

The elven shrine maiden grasped Kai's left hand and started pulling it. _TL Note:_ A bit of trivia: Japan is one of these countries where cars are right handed.

And as a stiff look appeared on her face...

"What is that thing...!"

"Jeanne, stop. There is something up ahead!"

All cars started to slow down at once.
Their wheels, stopping all of the sudden, blew up a pile of fallen laves, leaving them dancing in the air.

_TL TODO:_ `勢いよく回転していた車輪が止まった反動に噴き上げられて` The last `ni` is a bit weird as it rather sounds like wheels are blown up themself, but maybe it is just my lack of experience

"Rinne, just what kind of eyesight thee have? Being able to discover that before me..."

"Humph! I'm more useful to Kai than you."

Reiren and Rinne jumped out of the car.

"Kai, what's wrong? Did something happen?"

Jeanne appeared from the cadillac behind them.
Besides her was the female bodyguard Farin, walking with her sword already unsheathed.

"Rinne and Reiren spotted something.
Jeanne, wait here.
You should be ready to give orders at any moment, if there really is something there."

The Urza Resistance forces were about 150 in number.
And as it was not yet clear what [was there], it was unwise to move all forces.

"Kai, it might be good idea to take that with you."

"Mm... Yeah, got it."

Rinne, who peered into the driver's window, pointed at his black bayonet.
It was a general purpose assault bayonet [Drake Nail].
Looking similar to Drake's claw, it was a weapon, developed by MDA based on records from the Great War.

_Rinne tells me to take my weapon..._

_Is it dangerous to such an extent?_

"You're going to get devoured there."

Ominous words escaped lips of the elven shrine maiden.

"Since I'm used to walking in the forest, I'll be leading the way.
Kai, Rinne, follow me."

The elf leaped towards the ancient tree's root.

And then from root to root, just like a locust, she easily repeated her jumps with ease.
In the blink of an eye, her figure started to disappear.

"Oi, Reiren, you're going too far ahead alone... Damn it."

He exchanged glances with Rinne.
And then grabbing the Drake Nail, he ran after.

The forest was filled with piles of fallen leaves.
Having no idea what could be hidden behind the ancient trees and brushes, Kai had to remain cautious while running.

"Kai, be careful, if thee step on this mushroom, thy foot is going to be swollen"

"Uo!?"

"Ah, and that tree bug too. Its bite can take off a finger."

"As I thought, this forest is just absurd..."

Compared to the forest surrounding the elven village, it was an extremely big and strange natural system.
Still, Kai wondered what would make the elf, who was supposed to be very knowledgeable, to regard something as unnatural.

"Kai, it's here."

Reiren was beckoning him from the ancient tree.

_TL Note:_ I'm not really sure how author means `害` here?

"I suspect the evil being is no longer here.
Still do not relax.
We don't know where it could be hiding."

"What do you mean...?!
This is...!?"

A shiver went down his spine.
It became clear to him once Kai circled behind the ancient tree.

The trees were mowed down and devoured...

Dozens of fallen trees had their bark and branches chewed off with terrific strength.
On the ground were footsteps that resembled giant holes.
These were absurdly large footprints.

_Magical beasts that we saw in the demon's den were certainly big, but..._

_This looks much worse than their rampage._

It looked as if a raging storm had passed through.

"Well then, I'm at a loss here.
Certainly I'm proud of being knowledgeable about the forest, but..."

Said the elven girl, who was surveying the traces of destruction with an awkward expression on her face.

"I cannot fathom what could cause such ruckus.
Being able to mow down these ancient trees?
Just what sort of monster could do it?
There is certainly no living being like that in this forest."

"To me it looks like a giant dragon raging though..."

"Huh? Wait a second, Kai, where do thee think we are?"

Elven shrine maiden spread her hands.

"This land belongs to foreign gods.
We're in the east of great continent, while cryptids like dragons reside in the west.
They are on completely opposite sides of the continent."

"Sure, I know.
But is there any other race that is capable of such a feat?"

"..."

Having enough strength to mow down the ancient trees.
And leave these gigantic footprints, smashing and destroying everything.
There was no other race possessing such a destructive nature.

"I'm with Kai on this."

"Mm?"

"There is some animal's scent."

This gigantic footprint is not easy to recognize because of muddy ground.
But as Rinne brought her face closer, she could feel traces of it.

"Feels like a cryptid.
Cannot say which kind, but I'm certain it is not a dragon."

"...Truly?"

The elf became speechless.
This meant that a giant cryptid was able to trespass onto their, foreign gods', territory.
It was analogous to what humans would call burglars breaking into their house.

"Then what about this cryptid's size!?
If such a thing were to cross the border, the angels would have definitely noticed it!"

Among the foreign gods who lived in the forest were elves, dwarves and fairies.
On the other hand angels, who lived in their sky palaces, watched over the Io territory from the sky.
For Reiren it was obvious to place faith in their watch.

"I might have an idea about it.
On our way from Urza, we met a cryptid.
But at that time it was just a wyvern."

It was at the time when they departed from the capital of Urza, on their way to the Io.
On the highway amidst snowy mountain range, they were suddenly attacked by it.

[...Kai, above! It is coming from the sky!]

[Wyvern!]

[What is meaning of it, isn't it supposed to be the demon's territory? What is a cryptid doing here!?]

"...In the northern country? So thee were attacked by cryptids there?"

"I doubted my own eyes.
At that time we lost two cars in the battle.
We were fortunate that it ended only with that."

Even now they were puzzled by the goal of that cryptid, stepping onto Urza territory.

"Soon after Vanessa's defeat, we had a wyvern intrude upon Urza borders.
And now after Alfreyja's defeat.
The timing is quite similar I think."

"If cryptids are trespassing the territories of other countries..."

Reiren made a grimace.
While the elven shrine maiden was lost in thought, Jeanne's voice could be heard from the radio.

_TL TODO:_ `エルフの巫女が返事を探しあぐねている間に、通信機を経由してジャンヌの声が。` First part is a bit confusing, mostly because of `探しあぐねている`

[Kai, how is it?]

"We're doing all right here.
Jeanne, I think you can come here too.
It is just..."

The criminal behind the destruction had already left.
As Kai was watching the footprints which continued deeper into the forest, he tightly grasped the radio.

"We might have a hard time reaching the southern border."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a href="#Part2" id="Part2" class="Bookmark"></a>

The green maze was repainted by a madder red colour.
Behind the thick leaves, the sun could be seen going down to the horizon.
Before long, the night had arrived.

_TL Note:_ Author uses `生い茂る葉の上では` here, which is hard to get right for me so I re-phrased.
But probably I need to come back to it.

"Did I not tell that forest's ecosystem changes as day and night?"

"Lots more incests appear. Also big sized animals I think.
These are rarely approaching our village, but once night falls fairies are always laying down animal repelling spell."

They were in the clearing.
Assembling the tent, near the stream with spring water.
As Kai was working on setting up the tent, Reiren was observing with curiosity.

By the way, nearby was Rinne, who was sitting doing nothing.

"Hey, Kai? Is it done yet? It is so boring that I'm feeling sleepy..."

"I'll finish soon."

She was like a kitten who wanted to play.
Comparing to such Rinne, Reiren, who was looking with a great curiosity at tents, set up by humans, looked like a loyal dog.

"Come to think of it... Reiren, you seem calm now."

"What are thee talking about?"

"Well, there are lots of humans around.
Considering you've been sent with us as representative of the elven village, I expected you'd be complaining a lot...
Really, thanks."

Rinne and Reiren.
Both looked like a fairly skinned beautiful maidens.
As long as neither Rinne's wing or Reiren's ears are discovered, no one would suspect a thing.

"If I'd be on guard always, it would only make me suspicious, don't you think?"

Elven shrine maiden didn't even bat an eye at soldier, who passed by her back just now.
In such situation where she was surrounded by more hundred of enemies.

_TL Note:_ Ehm... Technically they are in truce though?

"That's why I restrain myself.
In all reality I want to fuss and complain about it."

"Well, I understand..."

"Still, it is hard for me to tolerate getting myself stained by human smell.
I shall take a stroll in the forest."

But before the elven girl, who stood up, turned her back towards them.

"Wait. Rinne, how about you tagging along with her?"

"Me?"

"...Still has no trust in me?"

Elven shrine maiden, who stood besides blankly blinking Rinne, frowned.

"Or do thee think I'll be up to no good, the moment thy eyes are averted?"

"It is simple: we saw the destruction during the day, didn't we?"

"...Mu."

"I want you to take a look around tent's surroundings.
If it is both of you, then it should be fine, is it not?"

It wasn't a matter of trust.
It was the opposite.
Precisely because elven knowledge was so highly valuable, she has been asked to patrol the surroundings after sunset, which would extremely dangerous task for Resistance's soldiers otherwise.

_TL Note:_ The last sentence is re-phrased.

"That is to say, this place is quite far away from these footprints, right?"

"They can cover one thousand and five hundred kilometres per day."

"?"

"From the known to me records: cryptids were able to perform assault of the city which was 1,500 kilometres away.
So to say these guys are able to traverse this much by just running over ground."

In the end cryptids are just enormous.
Therefore their sense of distance is different.
What would be like one kilometre for the human or the elf, wouldn't feel more than few meters to them.

_From that place it takes 3 hours on car._

_Even if it is more than 100 kilometres of straight path, we cannot be careless._

"It cannot hurt to be vigilant, don't you think?"

"I understand. Thee are such sort of human, after all."

Elven shrine maiden squinted.
Which looked as she was amused by him.

"It would seem it is me who wasn't taking thee seriously...
Hey, Rinne, let us go now.
Time to patrol."

"Yup, Kai, I'll be back soon."

Just like that with light footsteps, both girls headed into darkness of the forest in front of Kai's eyes.

_TL Note:_ `軽やかに宙を舞う` This is a bit hard to phrase, because I'm pretty sure it is not dance, but more like walking posture that resembles dancing? But how to name it?

"...Well, I'll continue setting up the tent then."

He finished putting anti-wind cover onto the tent.
But the moment he was about to move on the second one...

"Kai."

Jeanne, who appeared from behind, patted his shoulder.

"Did you see Reiren?"

"She went on lookout with Rinne, you wanted something from her?"

"No, it is fine then.
I was about to ask her to do the same thing actually.
And if Rinne is with her then she will not be able to pull any tricks so easily."

This was inevitable.
Jeanne's worry was also in line with Reiren own words few moments ago.

[Foreign gods keep their promises.]

So they would abide by their one year truce agreement, and Reiren was sent to accompany them for that purpose.
This is what elven elder told them, but Kai couldn't trust these words completely.

_From foreign gods point of view, humans are just inferior._

_So do they even intend to keep their promise with such humans... Jeanne's worry is natural._

There was no way to know when Reiren would just run away.
What makes Jeanne's wariness even more stronger is her duty as the Commander over more than hundred people, which was only natural.

"And, Kai, I'd like us to chat a bit."

"Us...?"

"Just us yes. It is going to be hard if my subordinates would hear us so let move away."

They moved towards the ancient tree, illuminated by a campfire.
Here besides brushes it wouldn't be too far from where they placed tents, but far enough so that no one would hear them.

"Here should be fine... Now that I think about it: We didn't have chance to talk much about it."

She changed from her energetic male voice to lovely and charming female one.
As she always keep herself disguised as a male commander she had to keep her voice as <span title="Not volume, but as if male's low voice">low sounding</span>.
But in front of Kai she could return back to her natural voice.

"About your sword."

She pointed at the Drake Nail, which was in holster on his back.

"When we fought Alfreyja, it looked to me like it was emitting light and then changing it's shape."

"Yeah, it wasn't your imagination."

"...I was wondering what sort of weapon is it?"

This weapon wasn't work of humans.
It was pretty obvious to Jeanne's eyes.
And it was obviously different from bayonet, which was indeed human's invention.

Code Holder.

It was the sword, which he found in [Demons Graveyard] where he once found himself lost.

"Even I don't know about it. I only picked it up."

"Eh?"

"I told before: in known to me history there was a human known as Sid."

"...I heard yeah. Sid was the one who brought us victory in the great war.
In history of your world that is."

"This Code Holder is said to be the sword that Sid wielded.
Although right now it is bayonet, but probably it will materialize in response to my voice.
How it works though is beyond me."

He always wondered why Sid's sword would end up in the graveyard.
And Kai's question was answered by demons hero Vanessa.

[Sid foresaw that something strange is going to happen with world.]

[Sid left this sword to me. In anticipation to this situation...]

Ability to severe the fate.
This was the power of this sword, and the only thing that Kai knew about it.

"Doesn't sound reliable." _TL Note:_ I'm a bit uncertain what `危うい` is referring to.

Silver haired commander made a sullen face.

"I might be barking at the wrong tree, after being helped by it, but I don't feel good about you using weapon that we don't know all that well.
This thing, it is not human weapon, isn't?"

"I think it might be elven magic tool or something similar."

It was indeed as Jeanne said: a mystery.

"But in that case, I also want to give a piece of my mind."

"You mean <span title="my attire">this</span>?"

Jeanne put her hand on the armour.
But she meant not the grey armour itself, but rather what was under it.

The thin silk that was covering her skin.
It was elven battle attire - clothes which emitted faint light, which made Jeanne a [Light Knight]

_I knew that it was one of the greatest treasures that got stolen from foreign gods and holds resistance against magic._

_But I didn't really give it much thought actually._

Angels bow and elven spirit garments.
These magic tools, that Jeanne had in her possession, could be used by angels and elves because they possessed magic power.
But it made him to wonder: why human without any magic power could put them in action?

_TL Note:_ `そこに疑問を持つべきだった。` and line before is re-phrased.

These were burial clothes, which shine was snatching away her life.

_TL Note:_ Author uses `体力` which can be interpreted in various ways.
I'm not exactly sure if Sazane-sensei means that it literally shortens her life or just affects her stamina.
I suspect first... :(

Even as they were just talking, it continued to snatch away her life.
If it would be the true world, Kai would do his utmost to stop her from wearing these elven spirit garments.
To not allow her to do something that would be snatching away her life.

But...
Right now Kai had no right to stop her, who continued to fight in this cruel world.

"No one coerced you into wearing this, right?"

"Of course, I decided to do so myself.
I was the only one who was fit for it."

With a firm smile, silver haired girl shook her head.

"Want to tell me to take it off?"

"Even I'd say, you wouldn't listen. I already knew it... Even before."

Commander Jeanne, who could upon herself a hope of the mankind.
She herself might not remember it.
But in the world, where mankind won the great war, Jeanne and Kai were childhood friends who were living next to each other and getting along well.

"If I start saying anything, you wouldn't listen."

"By that... You mean me in the world, from where you're, Kai?
Where we've been childhood friends."

"It is different now."

"...I'm aware of it. Though I'm not planning to fix it." _TL Note:_ She means her stubbornness.

"I know that."

Kai only responded with one big shrug to Jeanne's serious response.
He thought back on how many times he had exchange like that back in the true world.
Still, her firm character remaining unchanged like that, gave him strange feeling of relief.

"Should be fine still. Only five more minutes." _TL TODO:_ re-check `まだ平気よね。じゃああと五分だけ`

"M?"

"Hey, I want to ask something."

Her eyes upturned. She asked with mischievous smile:

"How was I in your true world, Kai?"

"How you ask... Well you've been my neighbour."

"No, no, I mean my personality, how I behaved and things like that.
After the great war was over with mankind's triumph it would be a peaceful world.
There is no Reistance, right?"

"Of course."

"I cannot even imagine it.
What sort of life I'd have, if I wouldn't become Resistance's commander.
Likely I also don't have to pretend to be a man, right?"

Fixing his gaze on her, Kai remained silent.
Wondering just what kind of girl was Jeanne E Anise in the true world.

_Will she remember once I tell her..._

_What I'm thinking... That would be just too nice to be truth._

The moment hope crossed his mind, Kai shut down this thought.
After all, it was just his selfish wish.

What's more, remembering it right now is not necessary a desirable thing for Jeanne herself.

"Hey?"

"...You've been quite popular."

Taking a big breath he continued.

"After humans won in the great war, four races have been sealed in graveyards.
Both me and you, Jeanne, were part of troops, responsible for safeguarding that."

"Could it be I'm also commander there?"

"No, no, but likely you will be in the near future."

Looking at her listening to him with such confidence, he kept a smile at heart.

_TL TODO_: Re-check? `自信満々にそう訊く彼女に、内心で苦笑いを堪えながら。`

"With my low position I'm just standing a watch around the graveyard.
But you, Jeanne, was planning to be heading to the capital.
Youngest, and moreover first woman at that."

"Oh, so, Kai, from you perspective I didn't change much then?"

"...Well, I was surprised to see you dressed as a man."

When he first met her at Neo Vishal, he was really quite surprised at Jeanne's change.
Even now seeing her in front of him, he felt the same.

"Jeanne that I know had her hair down and wore fashionable clothes."

"Me? Ahahah, then I'm definitely changed."

She burst into laughter.

_TL TODO:_ Check `少女が噴きだす`

"It is been a while since last time I wore a skirt.
The same about make-up, I don't think I even thought about becoming more feminine.
...But... Well, I see..."

_TL TODO:_ Check second sentence `お化粧だって女の子っぽくなろうなんて考えもしないし`

For a short while she laughed.
But soon enough his silver haired childhood friend's eyes shown sadness.

"I forgot already... When last time I've been yearning for such feminine things."

"..."

"Hey, Kai, I have something to say" _TL Note:_ She says `我が儘` which could said to be unreasonable/selfish, but I don't feel it is right. Potla?

"M?"

── Would you be my <span title="boyfriend">friend</span> even in this world?

_TL Note:_ There is very interesting furigana `ボーイフレンド`, Jeanne should go for it!
But pretty sure it would be more literal male friend though.
Well, you guys know who I'm rooting for anyway.

With her face slightly red, his silver hair childhood friend said, almost whispering.

"...Me?"

"It is not something I can ask of my subordinates in Resistance.
I'm their commander, so I cannot cross this line with them."

But that was different for Kai.

At most Kai is only outside helper.
Together with Rinne, he is looking for a way to return back the true world.
And coincidently their interests aligned with Urza Resistance, no more no less.

That's why...
Between these two was no boss-subordinate relationship.
They are just a boy and a girl of the same age.

"I don't mean to change anything, and it is not a request per se. Just...
Ehm, well, I miss... [friendship] quite a lot."

"..."

"N-not good...?"

"No. I'm surprised you've been thinking about such thing." _TL TODO:_ Check how to make better `なんだそんな事かと思って`

"It is serious matter, though!?"

Jeanne have risen her voice.

"After I finally summoned courage to say it!"

"I understand. Well, of course I'm glad to hear it."

It reminded him...
Kai didn't remember her saying something like that in the true world.
He thought back to their past.
Since childhood they've been playing together and there was no sense of [becoming friends].
Before he was even aware, they've been in such relationship already.

"Nothing changed, but best regards."

"Y-yeah!"

Instantly Jeanne's face brightened up and she responded with big nod.
And immediately following that...

A long scream resonated echoed from direction of the camp site.

"...!? What is going on!?"

Following it was even stronger scream.
Sounds of footsteps, which seemed as if belonging to a elephant, resonated throughout the forest.
They could hear dulled sound of tree's branches being broken.
And then gunshots...

"Kai!"

Jeanne was quick to react.
She only shouted Kai's name and rushed towards the camp site.

_Could it be what we encountered during the day...?_

_Oh well I wish my premonition of something bad would stop already_ TL TODO: Re-check `いや、だけど悪い予感で終わってくれ！`

Pushing aside the brushes he sprung out into the open.
Kai could see sparks from scattered bonfire, smashed trees and then, dyed in colors of dusk, head of gigantic beast.

For a second he thought it was a lion, but then he couldn't comprehend what sort of creature it was.
It had a mane, similar to that of line, but that was the only similarity with the lion.
Its forefoot were so burly, even thicker than human body itself.

It was 4, or maybe even 5 meters tall.
While half of it's body was hidden by brushes, likely it could span for over 15 meters.

"Is that a master of the forest!?"

"No. Jeanne, look at his forehead.
It might be hard to see now, but his vein is visible there.
So it is definitely a cryptid."

One could wonder if gigantic beasts, like whales, who swim across great oceans or elephants, who traverses plains, belong cryptids.
But the answer would be no.
No matter how big they are, to be called a cryptid, they must possess a certain organ, common to all cryptids.

It is called [Magic bloodline]. _TL Note_ `法力血界系` Maybe need a better name?

In their case magic producing organs of demons and foreign gods became small blood veins.
And this was the most prominent feature of cryptid race.

"There is dull glitter from the red vein on his forehead."

"During the day...! Did it follow us?"

Jeanne clenched her fists.

"Everyone, scatter."

Her hoarse voice echoed throughout the site.
While soldiers with machine guns were moving away from the beast, Farin nudged forward toward it with shamshir in her hands.

"This cryptid..."

As she started saying, she narrowed one eye like needle and continued. _TL Note:_ Don't ask me where it is coming from, Farin has this habit of closing one eye.

"Is it a Behemoth?"

[....!!!]

Cryptid roared.
Whether it was due to countless bullets firing at its body, or Farin's call, but it responded.
It started to rise it's forefoot.

_TL Note:_ Farin makes this `っと` sound which I has no idea how to translate

_TL TODO:_ `その鼻先をかすめ` is a bit unclear in the second sentence, below

Farin stomped the ground with great strength and moved to the side.
Gazing it's nose, beast mowed down the plain with tents below with it's foot.
Against such force anchors that were holding tent served a little purpose.
And wreckages of metal and cloth were blown far away.

"Hesitating here might get you killed". _TL Note:_ `迷いこんだ場所が徒となったな` I can think of different ways to interpret this phrase.

The cryptid was just too big for this forest.
Only half of the Behemoth's body could be seen from within gap between two trees.
While the remaining half was still stuck there, unable to free itself.

Towards the beast which lost it's balance.
Farin attacked beast's shoulder with her shamshir in both hands.
But it wasn't a slash, instead she used all of her arm strength and weight to slam the create with maximum impact.
But...

"Tch."

Her shamshir had been stopped by Behemoth's skin.
Hardened by hundreds years of life, it's skin was able to stop the sword, leaving it without a single wound.
The same thing as with bullets just few moments ago.

"As one would expect, that's a grown specimen..."

Kicking Behemoth's shoulder female warrior escapes from it into air.
Seeing everything from the very beginning, Behemoth slowly moves it's body towards Farin in the air, baring it's fangs to crunch her.

"Come here, beast."

Right under it, Kai aimed at beast's left foot with his Drake Nail.
Impact from this attack felt like he was hitting solid piece of rock.

_This thing is so sturdy! Is that really skin of living creature!?_

_And even recoil alone makes my hand numb._

He couldn't even cut for a millimeter.
Though in all honestly this blade was in first place designed with strength in mind, rather than sharpness.
So it was at most half-arse attempt.

_This is precisesly a thing against such absurdly armoured beasts like you._

Spark appeared at the edge of Drake Nail, like blooming red flower.
Then there was a blast. _TL Note:_ Sentence order is changed.

It was simplified drake bullet.

At it's core it was explosive that was trying to match power of fire breath of real Drake.
As soon as Drake Nail's blade strikes, it explodes and pours all of it's fires onto in such close proximity.
And this firepower was supposed to be enough to break through cryptid's armouring.

"No good, Kai, move away!"

Straining her throat Jeanne shouted towards him.
With fires and smokes limiting visibility, if it wouldn't be for Commander's yell, Kai could end up torn apart.

"...How!?"

From within the fire Behemoth's forefoot appeared.
Including it's toes, it looked like it wasn't even scratched.

"You gotta be kidding!"

He crouched on spot.
Leaving few strands of his hair in air.
If he would hesitate even for a split second, he would be tore apart by Behemoth's claw.

Drake bullet was ineffective.
One could wonder if it was due lack of firepower or whether blast from Kai's attack was just weak.
But most likely it was because this beast's skin was far more sturdy than anyone could predict.

_Drake Nail was made accordingly to records from the Great War._

_And of course information on Behemoth was present among cryptids data._

Which meant that comparing to the cryptid in records from the true world, this monster was far more tougher enemy.
Likely belonging to similar class of elder dragon.
And unless they have canon, there is no way to shoot it down.

"How troublesome.
Jeanne-sama, please move to the rear together with rest of the soldiers.
For this beast elven armour has no meaning" _TL Note:_ `この獣にはエルフの霊装が通じません` is a bit confusing.

Said Farin, who stood besides Kai.
Shamshir in her hands had been slowly heating up and becoming red from it.

"It is just too big.
If it would be a dragon we could at least try to crush it down from sky, but with this guy it is not going to work.
Any suggestions?"

"I'm thinking...
If anything forest helped us."

For Behemoth with it's enormous body, trees around it became a cage.
Even now trees remain in it's way and preventing Behemoth from moving freely.
It can only slowly creep in.

"What would be prudent to do..."

While glaring at the large beast.

"Is to aim at it's forehead. I think it is weak point."

There on forehead was blood vein.
It was [magic bloodline], rudimentary magic organ.
And it was vital point, commonly found among cryptids.

But of course even Urza Resistance soldiers knew it.
That's why they were concentrating their fire on forehead, but Behemoth's skin was able to repel their bullets.
And therefore they were unable to pierce down below, where vein was.

"Either me or you has to strike his forehead."

"Sound strategy. Putting aside if we can actually do it."

They had to consider whether Kai's Drake Nail explosive blast or Farin's shamshir slash could do the dead.
But...

"!"

"Move!"

In few moments ground was stomped upon.
The moment he felt chills from the wind pressure, giant beast hand already landed in the middle between Kai and Farin, who jumped to their respective sides.
Masses of sand and earth were flying around, together with fallen leaves.

_We shouldn't get too close to it._

_That beast might be slow, but once it aims for it's prey, it gets so damn fast!_

Amids constant gunshots and Behemoth's roaring, something fell from the sky.

"Take cover!"

White smoke with strong smell enveloped the area, reducing visibility to zero.
Breathing it in was so hard, almost making you to choke, as if it was some sort of dust from minerals.
In a blink of eye, their camp site became fully covered with it.

One would think it was a tear-gas.
But in fact it affected neither eyes or nose, so...

"Reiren!"

"It is mist mushroom.
Took me some time to gather."

Breaking though the smoke, elf rushed forward with her vibrant seventh layered robs on.

"...Cryptid, breaking into our forest with such audacity is going too far!"

Elven shrine maiden aimed her silver, like full moon, knife at the beast's foot.
Splashing it's venomous blood...

Beast roared in anger.
Reiren clicked her tongue with unpleasant expression, stopped her attack and jumped back.

"Tch, even this magic blade unable to pierce it in the end..."

"...Kai!"

He heard voice from above.
Amidst white smoke, he could see spread tenma wings of girl who was descending.
With her blond hair fluttering, she was looking like a descending angel.

She looked otherworldly majestic.

"Hold onto me!"

He responded by grasping girl's hand above his head.

"Going up!"

He felt the wind with his whole body.
Wind pressure, created by Rinne's wings, together with magic power very quickly moved Kai into air.

_I see now. This smoke wasn't to deceive the Behemoth._

_It is to hide Rinne's wings!_

With this she could hide from eyes of soldiers who were gathered here.
Moreover, being concealed from the beast, together with winged girl he could fly up to the trees.
To get right above the beast itself...

And from there he could see Behemoth's forehead.
Filled with magic power blood vein, slightly lit with red.

"We can do it now. Rinne, start descending now."

To strike down the weak point.

But Kai's resolve was drown in the beast's breathing.
Right below two of them, Behemoth leaned with his neck, looking straight in their direction.
With extraordinary speed, it twisted it's neck and bared it's fangs at them.

"It noticed!? Impossible, being able to sniff out among these spores..."

"Is it magic!?"

Similar thing happened during retake of capital Urzak, numerous demons were pursuing Rinne by following her magic.

_Even though it is just a little, but cryptids posses magic power._

_So it wouldn't be surprising for some individual to be able to spot the same magic._

The way it goes, Kai suspected it wouldn't end with the beast just spotting them.

"Rinne, let go of me!"

"Kai!? No way... It is dangerous!"

He brushed off the hand of girl, who was trying to grasp him.
He made a swoop aiming at the Behemoth amidst the white smoke.
Adding left hand to a grip on the Drake Nail in his right hand, he raised it overhead.

_TL Note:_ Last sentence need improvement `右手に握る亜竜爪に左手を添えて、頭上へ振りあげる。`

Just below there was a enormous mouth that could chew off human in single mouthful.

"Kaiii!?"

Rinne screamed.
Human, without wings, would only be bound by gravity to fall down.
Using this momentum, Kai swung down his black bayonet.

Behemoth's fang against imitation of Drake's nail.
As Rinne gasped, two <span title="刃">blades</span> passed by few centimeters.

"Explode!" _TL Note:_ I'm still unsure which word to choose for `爆ぜろ`

Then amids white smoke...
Explosion from drake bullet burned and smashed vital spot on the Behemoth's forehead.
As soon as Kai confirmed it with his own eyes, he dropped down.

_TL TODO:_ `……ぴちゃっ` Just tell me what is this sound...

Soon enough the ground was dyed by red blood.
As Kai's sword reached it, the beast's fang too reached Kai's shoulder, tearing off a piece of it.

"Ouch!"

Looking at the crawling on his knees human, the beast, while staggering, raised it's forefoot preparing to trample over.
But the cryptid didn't notice at that moment.
While it was so focused on Kai, under the beast's foot were forming magic circle.

"It is complete." _TL TODO:_ Not sure how to understand `誘導` in `誘導完了じゃな`

Elven shrine maiden placed both of her hands onto trunk of a large tree.
There was a small magic circle, which could be used to activate teleportation trap.

"Where thou think it is?
This is a foreign gods domain"

This was elven trap, which entrapped emperor Dante before.
Magic circle, under the Behemoth's feet, slowly started to emerge.

"I shall send you to the garden of crimson lotus.
There feel free to rage around to your heart's content."

Light erupted.
And the enormous Behemoth disappeared in front of Kai without even a shriek.

It was teleported towards the valley where purgatory flowers blossom...

<br>

"I gave it invitation to garden, burning as hot as magma.
Though no idea whether it will be able to escape somehow or just get burn alive."

"...Guess one problem is solved."

He let go of Drake Nail and sat right there on the ground.

"That was quite reckless.
At that moment even I was struck with fear.
Still, as long as thee is safe, all is good, but really, that's quite a luck: evading Behemoth's fang during such suicide assault...
Kai!? That wound...!"

Kai silently took off his jacket.
Seeing the state of his left shoulder, Reiren's expression froze.
The elf who only thought of it as a scratch, finally saw how bad it was.

Even meat was gouged out on his left shoulder, leaving white under flowing blood.
The wound was reaching even bones.
Twenty more centimeters.
And the beast's fang would reach even his lungs.

And if it would slide ten more, it would pierce his heart.

_I was really lucky that beast wasn't able to see me in smoke._

_If not for that fact, I could end up being chewed by it._

"KAI!?"

Rinne, who returned from skies, also became speechless at the sight of his bleeding wound.
But it continued only for few seconds, then she clung towards him from behind, embracing him with both of her hands with all of her strength.

"... Don't... Do it."

He could hear her crying.
The body of girl, who was clinging to him from behind and didn't wish to leave, started to tremble like a frightened puppy.

"...Why... such reckless thing.
I don't want to see you... so badly wounded.
I hate seeing Kai in such pain..."

"We beat it, didn't we?"

"...No!"

Rinne's cry echoed throughout whirlpool of white smoke.

"It was really close call, you know?...
I... really didn't know what to do when Kai let go of my hand..."

"It is good that I was alone in that."

"Eh!?"

He took out pain killers from his pouch and took few of these pills.

![Rinne and wounded Kai](./p081.jpg)

Using his right hand, which was in a far better shape than his completely immobile left hand, he placed his palm against onto girl's hand.

"As long as it keeps you safe."

"!"

_TL TODO:_ I still have no idea how to go around Rinne's race `混沌種`

The moment she understood the meaning of his words, she gasped.

At that time...
The one, towards whom enormous Behemoth reacted, wasn't Kai, it was Rinne after all.

_Since he turned towards us in response to magic power..._

_The one who it aimed for wasn't me, but Rinne._

_TL TODO:_ `噛み砕こうとした標的もだ。`

At that moment Rinne was holding Kai while flying.
If the Behemoth would sprung at them, Rinne wouldn't be able to to escape up in time.

Carrying him made it impossible...
Therefore Kai left Rinne and was forced to face the enormous beast, that aimed to get at Rinne.

Ideally he hoped to finish it with one strike.
But even if it wouldn't work, Rinne could have enough time to fly up.
That was the truth of it.

"Ah, I don't mean that my wound is because of it.
It is my fault and lack of training..."

"Stop it."

Girl's hands were full of strength.

"Please... If you say more... I'm just... going to cry..."

"..."

"...I don't really understand myself it.
I'm both happy and sad, which is confusing.
Seeing Kai caring about me so much makes me so happy...
But seeing Kai hurt makes me just sad too..."

She shook her head. _TL TODO:_ `ふるふると、首を振りながら` Not sure how to phrase it together

"If I'm gonna cry it is going to be very loud, you know...?
Even louder than that Behemoth."

"Please spare me."

With a faint smile, he took out bottle of antiseptic and bandage to stop bleeding.
But as he couldn't move his left hand, there was no way he could apply treatment himself.

"Where is Kai! What about Behemoth!?"

From within the smoke he could hear footsteps.
And it was around this time when Jeanne, accompanied by her soldiers, arrived with a tensed look on her face.

Seeing Kai on the ground finally calmed her down for a moment.
But soon enough she saw both Kai's wound and blood under his feet, opening her eyes wide.

"Medic squad, asap!
We need to prepare for a surgery immediately!"

"My bad, Jeanne.
Met some unexpected troubles.
But in the end we were able to trick Behemoth into falling in the elven trap."

"Don't talk.
First we need to stop blood, then talk."

With bandages, that she took from Kai, she skillfully patched up his shoulder all over.

Without even bating eye at getting her own hands covered in blood...

"...As commander, I'm thankful for your efforts in battle.
But, do you know how it feels for me getting so worry just after we became friends?"

She said quietly, so that no one but Kai could hear her.
