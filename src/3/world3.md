At the naturally created border...
It is been three days and nights since they passed through the forest, controlled by foreign gods.
Finally they found vast plain of ocher colour, where was the national border that separated Io and Yurun.

"I'm able to guide thee only up to here."

Said the elven shrine maiden, who looked reluctant seeing off the fading away forest.

"Beyond these plains lies the Yurun country. Thee know this much, right?"

"That's right. Still again quite a depressing scenery..."

Ashlan answered from the driver's seat.
As Kai's arm was wounded in the battle with the Behemoth, right now he assumed the driving role.

"I thought I got tired of this maze of big trees, now it is just plains with weed all the way."

"Right so. Having nothing instead makes makes you suspicious too, right..."

Sitting on the passenger seat, Saki was anxiously looking with her binoculars through a window.

"Talking about the border.
Aren't four races supposed to watch over it normally?"

"It is but a exaggeration.
Only demons watch over the entire border.
As only they possess sufficient numbers."

Reiren said from the back seat on the right.

"By the way, Kai, how is thy wound on the left arm?"

"Hey, you!"

From the left came Rinne in order to 'restrain' her.

"I'm worrying about Kai's arm.
Kai, is it ok?"

"Muu. There is anyway nothing to do, might as well not to mind a small talk."

Reiren was having a seat on the right side.
While Rinne was on the left.

Being caught from both sides, Kai leaned on the back of his seat.

_TL Note:_ `座席のシート` Ehm... Honestly sometimes I think I don't know japanese

"It is all right, but it would nice if you wouldn't cling to my arm so much..."

As his arm was fixed with a bandage, he was unable to move it.

But then Rinne was clinging to Kai with such arm, not leaving his side.
Of course he appreciated her [I'm going to protect you] sentiment, but each time Rinne would put in some strength,
Kai would feel impact through the whole arm up to the shoulder, making his wound to ache and becoming source of his worry.

"Hey, Saki. How long should we go?"

"Mmm, some more time I guess?
But well even I've gotten tired of driving the car."

They've been on the road three days and three nights.
By now Kai's party traversed several hundred kilometers.
Consisting of 30 military cars, closely following each other, their party was starting to run out of both provisions and battery capacities.

_TL note:_ Interestingly author always mentions batteries, but never oil, like cars don't need it there.

"It is going to take a while to reach the human city...
After all this map is like ten years old, so how reliable it is I'm not sure."

For a while now Saki was continuing to stare at the map of the continent. _TL Note:_ Re-phrased `サキが睨めっこを続ける相手は大陸地図。`

"Hey, isn't that the thing?"

Rinne, who was looking out of the window, pointed straight ahead at the horizon.

"There is town of humans."

"Hm? Where it is, Rinne? I cannot see anything there.
Wait, wait, where are binoculars...
Ah, it is really there!
Looks like some sort of abandoned building...
Wait, ehh... What's that!?"

Saki raised her voice in surprise as she was looking through binoculars.

"...A little perilous."

Reiren who got up from the back seat, knitted her eyebrows.

"Kai, can thee contact Jeanne behind?
These ruins, these are not simple buildings.
Might be better to make a detour.
It is a nest of the spirits."

"Really!? Jeanne, this is the vanguard car, answer me!"

He tightly grasped the radio.
Without waiting for a reply, Kai continued his report to commander's car, which was following them.

Rinne and Reiren, whose eyesight surpassed that of Kai, were already able see a scenery beyond the horizon.

"Ahead on our path are ruins, which became a nest of spirits.
I suggest taking a detour!"

[I was going to contact you about it.] _TL TODO:_ A bit unclear phrase `その連絡をしようとしていたところだ`

He couldn't sense any worry in Jeanne's voice.

[We're receiving directions on the course to our destination from a signal corps of Yurun Resistance.
And we're told to head straight ahead as it is.]

"Then..."

[There is indeed the nest of spirits among that group of building.
However no longer there can be found any spirits.
It would seem that about two years ago they moved to a another place.]

_TL TODO:_ Second sentence refer to spirits as `肝心の聖霊族` and it is unclear how to interpret `肝心の`

"...Meaning it is completely empty, huh?"

It was similar to the migration of birds.

Spirits had a tendency to frequently migrate from their nests each dozen of years.
But a reason was unclear.

"But there is a chance that some remain on lookout, is it not?"

[There will be few at most.
We've been requested to intercept them in case we'll have an encounter.
Put it simply: While Yurun Resistance welcomes us, they also intend to test us at the same time.]

Just few spirits.
If they would go all out against them, it wouldn't be a serious threat.

[For us it would be welcoming experience.
Before full blown confrontation with spirits, I believe it would be valuable for us to gain experience fighting them right now]

"Therefore heading straight to it, huh..."

Just beyond the horizon shadow of the city could be spotted with naked eye.

On these vast plains, illuminated by intense rays of sun, queer scenery appeared in front of Kai's own eyes.

...Shining ruins.

Steel buildings were covered by something moss-like, casting lights.

Was it spider threads or maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha">hyphae</a>?

It looked like a shining object d'art.
Once a human city, it had been transformed into bizarre [nest].

_Demons just use human's cities as it is when they snatch it._

_Foreign gods are not living in human cities at all and instead letting it to get consumed by the forest._

But spirits were different.

They just transform city's buildings into completely different thing.
One had to wonder just what kind of life form could make such nest.
_TL TODO:_ Re-check second sentence `いったいどんな生態であれば、こんな巣が出来上がるというのか`

"Whew... that's gross.
Buildings are completely covered in something like bluish mold."

"Ashlan, turn a bit to the right now.
We don't really need to go through the center of ruins.
Whenever possible we should go by the edge of the city."

As they were going through ruins that became a nest to the spirits.
In order to pass this eerie building even a second faster, they started to raise the speed.

"Rinne, just to be sure, did you have to fight spirits before?"

"Mmm, just a bit?
But I really disliked it cuz I had no idea what spirits are thinking."

"...Undoubtedly they are not someone you can talk with."

<span title="Yes, you didn't read wrong. It is スライム">Slimes</span>. Ghosts. Lanterns.
Among five races, including humans, they were the only race that didn't use human language.
The reason for that was quite simple: they didn't posses intelligence to comprehend language.

Therefore any discussion was out of question.

"Ah, but spirits are well versed when it comes to creeping around.
They can hide from sight and completely eliminate any sound...
Who might know if our car is not already in their sights."

"Please stop, Reiren!?"

Saki screamed while tightly gripping her hand grenade as if it is a precious talisman.

Guns were ineffective against the spirits.

While bullets could wound slimes, they would quickly restore themself up.
As for ghosts and lanterns bullets would just pass through them.

They had to be completely destroyed by flame or blast.

[Preparing counter-measures against traits of each race is very bothersome.]

[There is a universal way to overcome such resistances regardless of race.
That is a _blast_.]

_TL Note:_ These are Vanessa's lines from V1C5

Seeing Saki holding hand grenade so dearly made Kai to remember the Vanessa.

At that time...
Never ever he would imagine himself doing something like coming to spirits' land.

"Okay, we're already leaving the city."

"...Ah, nice. I was thinking my life is going to shorten."

Kai's car passed buildings.
Following them was the second car, then the third and so on, passing through the spirit' nest,
but there was no signs of anything threating to attack them.

"Jeanne, how are things on your end?"

[We're passing through without troubles.
Though unfortunately it also means that we're not going to meet the Yurun's Resistance's expectations.]

From the other side of radio he heard Commander's self-deprecating laugh.

[To all cars, follow road straight ahead.
We're heading towards the Yurun's Resistance headquarters.
Their leader is a renowned commander Balmnung-dono, also commonly known as _Lion King_.
Be mindful to not act impolite.]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a href="#Part2" id="Part2" class="Bookmark"></a>

A stronghold among wilderness Ruin S Fulham.
The <span title="jp. 赤煉瓦">red brick</span> castle.
Once it was a land where a family, who lost a fight for a crown of Yurun, had escaped.

And this stronghold, which was the last hope of mankind that has been crushed by Spirits' invasion...
Was a headquarters of the Yurun's Resistance.

"Welcome to our Resistance Army.
Let us greet expedition of our fellow army!"

_TL Note:_ Original greeting: `ようこそ我らの人類反旗軍へ。貴軍らの遠征を歓迎するものである！`
First phrase is clear: he welcomes them at the HQ.
But the second is a bit more tricky as it kinda repeats a similar thing, but with a stronger emotional emphasis (due to `ものである`) and with their guest to be a subject
So my I feel it is more like a command to his subordinates to greet guests?

With hundreds soldiers be his side...

The giant man with his golden hair and bear, befitting of a lion, loudly exclaimed.

His upper torso looked even greater than that of his subordinates.
But despite his fierce look that would make left any child crying, his voice didn't sound harsh.

He was the Lion King Balmnung.

_Exact opposite of the emperor Dante._

_Despite his large frame and fierce look, meeting him face to face doesn't feel so suffocating._

_TL Note:_ Let's be honest, Dante can only cause you to feel disgusted, I doubt his presence would pressure anyone.

In front of Kai Light Knight Jeanne came forward and shared firm handshake with Lion King Balmnung.

"Thank you for coming all this way.
Jeanne-dono, rumours of your great achievements reached even this remote land.
I want to borrow your strength."

"It is nice to meet you, Balmnung-dono.
I thank you for your welcome."

Comparing to the Lion King Balmnung's stature, Commander Jeanne, who was disguising as a man, looked like a child.
Despite their physique being like that of a child and adult, Lion King didn't show any hint of mocking that.

"Balmnung-dono, are we going to gather for the meeting as it is?"

"While this is what I'd like to say, but your honorable army requires a rest after such long trip.
Not to mention your cars would need some checking to do.
Allow my engineering squad to assist with that."

He pointed to the stronghold's entrance.

"Jeanne-dono, we could go together to the office.
Well, nothing like a strategy meeting, just a small talk."

"Meaning?"

"The good news of you crushing the demons' hero and foreign gods submitting to you.
I would be glad to hear about it in details.
As I wish to spread these news among seven cities in the Yurun too."

"I understand, then by all means."

Lion King Balmnung walked with a long stride, and Jeanne joined him by the side.

"...This is quited different from our time in the Io.
Quite decent commander."

"Really.
I felt Dante was like a sly king, but here I can see a leader of soldiers.
Well, he looks scary though."

Saki and Ashlan were whispering to each other.

On other hand behind them was elven shrine maiden Reiren who was grumbling with a sullen look on her face:
[Foreign gods submitting?
Huh, what a joke.
It is just a cease fire.]

"Hey, Kai?"

Rinne pulled his right hand's sleeve. _TL TODO:_ I'm pretty sure you don't say it like that in english, so need to fix this literal translation.

"What are we going to do now?
Jeannya already left though?."

"Yeah, let's see... ehm."

"For you it should be all for today.
I'll attend to Jeanne-sama, so you can go ahead to rest up."

As Farin was going after Jeanne, she whispered to his ear when passing by him.

"This place has a trustworthy commander. He is different from the Dante."

"Could it be you know him?"

"For about a year.
I just served here during my training."

She said with a profound smile.

Leaving it at that, the female guard disappeared inside the castle.

<br>
<br>

Human city Ruin S Quin.

It was located 30 meters under the stronghold Rin S Fulham...
The largest known underground city of Yurun, which could be reached by taking a elevator inside a solid bedrock.

Similarly to Urza's Neo Vishal it utilized underground railway system, but there was one main difference and that was a scale.

Neo Vishal was at most of the size as single shopping district.

While Ruin S Quin was said to almost completely replicate the scale of Yurun's capital.

Thanks to vast plains they benefited from wind and solar energies.
Due to that they were able to maintain all production factories.

The cornerstone of it all was...
Throughout defense of Ruin S Fulham stronghold.

"You're not Balmnung-dono's people."

Human city, Ruin S Quin, northern district...

Inside the hospital, which also filled with piles of books and served as library, old head doctor was skillfully undoing Kai's bandages.

_TL Note:_ It doesn't said _inside_ in original text, but it sounds better this way

"I'm not versed in nature of spirits.
They look for humans' ruins and make their nest out of it.
You'd think they'll make it their base, but a few years later they abandon the nest and start the migration."

"...They abandon their own territory?"

"There are cases when destination of the said migration is humans' shelters too.
As they abandon old territory they start searching for the new one.
Almost as if they are locust swarm."

He finished undoing bandages covered in blood and dust.

"...Oh?"

The old doctor opened his eyes wide beyond lens of his glasses.
He fixated his gaze unto wound left by Behemoth's fang gouging Kai's left shoulder.

"It even took some meat from your shoulder.
You're young, but did well to endure it.
Disinfecting also was quite painful, wasn't it?"

"Luckily, I had painkillers on me."

"Fool. It is not such minor wound.
Fortunately the wound itself didn't fester, but..."

Next old man's gaze shifted to Kai's face.

"Your face doesn't look like of someone reckless.
In contrast with your appearance."

"...I've been told that I'm stubborn."

"For forty years that I've been examining soldiers that come here I cannot remember seeing such gruesome wound.
I cannot imagine fight with spirits would cause such wound though."

"I've been bitten by a bit large beast..."

"Bitten, you say?
Meaning this wound on your shoulder is left by teeth?"

A hand of the old doctor, who was re-applying bandages, stopped.

"And what was the beast that could leave such large teeth marks?
Could it be you've been attacked by a dragon?"

"Something like that."

"..."

The old doctor was speechless.

If it would be a soldier or a civilian then they would just laugh it off as a [absurd joke],
but this old doctor could guess the size of monster from the marks of fang that left the wound on Kai's shoulder.

"It will be one of two.
Either you die young or become great warrior like Balmnung-dono...
Now then, examination is over.
I'll prescribe you strong painkillers."

"Will it be ok to hold a gun?"

"Wouldn't recommend.
You'll be unable to use left arm for a time being.
While painkillers will do their job, your grip will remain weak either way."

He was weakened.
While his face didn't show it, this is what he felt about the situation.

Jeanne and Urza Resistance were going to participate in the fight against spirits.

In situation where he couldn't use one of his hands, if he would for example end up fighting the spirits' hero then...

"What is it?"

"I was just thinking.
Going need to use every possible trick to survive."

No soldier that protects the city has to pay money here...

Kai bowed to the old doctor who firmly refused to take any payment and left the infirmary behind.

<br>
<br>

Public cottage.
Normally soldiers were staying at the one of the seven Yurun's cities,
And occasionally they would gather at stronghold Ruin S Fulham for opening of large council of war.

This was one of the lodgings they would use during that time.

"This is cool.
Since these lodgings are used by soldiers they got conference room here,
and they mentioned something about lending us tools to look after our guns, right?"

"Moreover it is completely lent to us.
They are so welcoming that it is actually scared me."

Saki and Ashlan were taking the baggage out of the car.

As he saw the two walking down the corridor with plenty of baggage...

"Hm?"

He heard a energetic voice from within of a room that was allocated to them.

"It is completed!" _TL Note:_ Reiren

"Hey, hey, are you sure it is going to be ok?
It smells a great deal..."

"Thee can leave it to me.
If thee would like, how about sampling it?"

"Mmm, rather not to."

These voices belonged to Rinne and Reiren.

He asked both of them to take care of their luggage while he was going to the old doctor,
but surprisingly he could hear lively voices on the other side of the door.

_TL TODO:_ Re-check `医者に診てもらう間に荷物を運んでくれと頼んでいた二人だが、扉の向こう側から妙に賑やかな叫び声`

"Hey, Rinne? Reiren?
...Eeww, what's this smell!?"

His nose was assaulted by awful smell.

As soon as he opened the door he was attacked by a bizarre mix of sweetness, like that coming from condensed milk, together
with a rotten smell that would make you cough when you inhale it.

"I'll open the window to ventilate..."

"What is thee saying? I'm just making a elixir. Look."

Elven shrine maiden pridefully shown off a flask.

Just as Kai brought his nose closer to slowly boiling pink liquid, he was assaulted by even stronger smell that filled the room.

"What a terrible smell, but is that an elven elixir...?"

It was said that elves and dwarves who were living in the forest would combine together various fruits and leaves that were natural remedies and create elixirs, holding mysterious powers.

_Potion that could cure ten thousand illnesses with a single drop._

_Sake that could tame any animal in the forest._

And there was a thing that Reiren hold in her hand.
To Kai it felt like a smell of a juice, squeezed out of food scraps.

"Thy wound, human medicine is unlikely to have much of effect, isn't it?"

Reiren looked at his bandages.

"That said thee would be troubled fighting spirits in such sorry state.
Therefore as a special, I thought of trying to make elixir that would cure your wound in half of day."

"Half of day!?"

"Umu. If thee drinks it this evening, tomorrow it shall be healed completely without leaving any single trace of the wound."

"Hearing you now makes me less inclined to try it though..."

"Well, I wouldn't mind two thousand massages as a reward too."

"Are you old man!?
...Ah, well, I guess you're older than human elderly."

_TL Note:_ No one would mind giving her such reward... aside from our hero ofc.
Ei, Kai, what are you doing!? Reiren is such good girl and you cannot even reward her properly!?

As he received the flask from Reiren, he was fixated his gaze inside.

That pink liquid.
Even though it wasn't burning hot, it continued to boil on it's own.
And then there was this smell that would wake you up.

It was so suspicious looking that he wasn't even sure where to start with.

"What about this pink colour?"

"Umu. See, the finishing touch is a fruit of the <span title="jp. 冬仙花">winter mountain flower</span>.
Boiling it and then drinking would greatly boost body's metabolism...
Or so I'd like to say, but this herb grows only deep inside the elven forest,
therefore I had to substitute it with a different thing."

"Eh. But this is a human's town.
Would there be a replacement?"

For Reiren, who was part of foreign gods, this place was a enemy's den.

It was hard to imagine that this elven shrine maiden, who wouldn't go out unless she is with Kai, walking around the city.

"I've requested Rinne."

"Rinne?
Did you find some alternative remedy on the market?"

Saying that, Kai noticed in Rinne's hand a small plastic bag for a shopping.

"So see, this flat elf said that winter mounter flower's fruit is small and red,
that's why I was looking for a similar fruit."

"What did you buy?"

"Strawberry."

"Not good!?" _TL Note:_ I'm honestly not sure if Reiren is asking or stating a fact.

Without even testing it was obviously a failure as the replacement.

"This sweet smell, is that a strawberry...?"

"Hey, Kai.
Do not sniff it like a timid dog,
summon thy courage and just drink it to see for yourself.
There would be no other chance for a human to try out elven elixir."

"This boiling thing?
Obviously it is going to burn my throat, but how do elves drink it?
Do you not cool it?"

"I do not know."

"Eh?"

The moment elven shrine maiden gave him answer with such serious face, Kai turned white.

"This is a first time for me to see such boiling thing.
I wonder if there was some sort of mistake when mixing it."

"Obviously there is some mistake, isn't!?"

"Well, worry not, just gulp it in one go."

She pushed flask with suspicious liquid towards him.

"...Well then Reiren try a single gulp and see how it goes.
If everything is all right then I'll drink it too."

"Very well. See then."

Taking the flask into her hand the elf sipped directly from it.
With a deep gulp, she finished.

"See for thyself.
Smell might bother, but once savor it, thee shall feel invigorating."

"Oh? Really."

"..."

![Reiren with flask](./p133.jpg)

"Reiren?"

"...Blarghhh...!"

"Vomiting blood!?
Isn't it a complete failure?
Oi, Reiren, come on!"

The elf fell down with a cry of agony

_I'm lucky to not drink it._

Kai felt relieved all the while patting her back.
