## Synopsis

“Why does no one remember the true world?!”

The era when the five great races were competing for hegemony ended with the victory of mankind led by the hero Sid.
However, that world was suddenly “overwritten” in front of a boy named Kai.
In the rewritten world Kai could see a result of mankind's defeat in great war due to absence of their hero Sid.
Now dragons and demons were dominating world, and Kai has been forgotten by all of mankind.
However, upon meeting the mysterious girl Rinne, Kai resolves to destroy the overwritten fate.
In a world without the hero, he inherits Sid's sword and martial arts, in order to challenge the mighty enemies of various races who reign supreme.
