_TL Note:_ Hokora is a mini shinto shrine.

The green labyrinth [Ciel Mir Forest] - was a natural maze, with many trees, towering over the place, being lined up in disarray.
With cover of their thick and dense leaves, only handful of light being able to pass through.

They walked over muddy leaf mould.
Leaves, blown by wind, were shaking and rustling with a pleasant sound.
The serenity of this land was likely undisturbed for hundred years
And now that...

"Kai, cannot thee run it more silently?
This thing, thee call a car, is just too noisy.
It spoils the forest's serenity."

"I'm already doing my best here, you know?"

He already lost count of how many times Reiren, who was sitting besides him on passenger seat cross-legged, complained.

"It might not seem like that, but we got low noise tires so it is actually quite silent ride.
I already explained, but behind us we got 30 cars lined up."

"...Good grief."

"By the way, this road is quite thin..."

"Indeed so, but it shall not become any more thinner though, so these cars shall be able to pass."

Shrine maiden pointed in front of a front window.
With Reiren showing them the way, Urza Resistance Army, led by Jeanne, was crossing the unmapped forest.
...The largest forest in the world.

While looking up a great tree, that was completely filling the sight before them, 28 military cars were passing through.
And Kai was driving the car, that was leading them.
He was driving in accordance with Reiren's guidance, who was sitting on passenger seat,
and following from behind was regiment of vehicles.

_TL Note:_ There are two confusing points: First it was 30 but then 28?
Another thing is that here author also uses `車両` which is rather translated as railway transport.

"Kai, turn to the right here."

With these words, all of the sudden Reiren directed him to the right.

"Here?"

"We just passed by it would seems."

"Couldn't you tell me 5 seconds earlier!?"

He quickly steered the wheel.
Towards the road, entangled by roots of the ancient tree.
Because of the roots, the road was uneven and it also obscured their field of vision.
But what helped them is that this road was as wide as the main road.

"This time it is quite wide road, but..."

"Atractylodes purine passed here.
Look at these trees with their barks being peeled off.
These are marks left by Atractylodes purine."

_TL Note:_ wtf is `オケラチュチュプリン`

"Atractylodes...?"

"It is huge hedgehog.
When it becomes round, its diameter can be around 10 meters."

Reiren nonchalantly answered.

"It rarely appears, but when it comes rolling over car, there will be nothing left."

"Wait a sec...!?"

"Hey, wait a second!?"

From their back seats on left and right, Resistance soldiers Saki and Ashlan shouted.
Up until now they remained completely bored, but now they reached out in confusion.

"Wait, wait, Reiren-chan!? You're our expert on this elven forest, aren't you?
What are we going to do if this thing appears!"

"That's right, are you sure it is good idea to take this road!?"

"No need for worry."

Said the shrine maiden, who folded her arms with confidence.

"This forest is akin to my own garden.
It is fine, leave it to me."

She was their <span title="jp. 地質 is geology, but that's pretty much wrong term here and most likely it was supposed to be 地理">geographer</span>, Reiren.
Right now in addition to her seventh layered garments she wore white robe, and her long ears were hidden under the hair.
Her background was a researcher from Io Resistance, who was going to lend her hand -
This was how Jeanne explained her presence to soldiers like Saki and Ashlan.

"Mu..."

Rinne started sulking from her seat at the back.

"I cannot agree with this arrangement.
Why this elf.... I mean Reiren is sitting with Kai together and enjoying herself."

"I'm supposed to guide thee, am I not?
Humans maps have nothing on the forest after all."

Reiren glanced at the Rinne behind.

"Well, I'm more talented that thee after all."

"That's not true...! You... damn flat elf!"

"What's wrong with being flat!"

"Please, calm down, both of you."

The moment Rinne said the [elf] Kai was struck with utter terror, but it would seem neither Kai or Ashlan shown no sign of noticing it.

_TODO:_ `人類未開の森を突っ切っている最中で、それどころではないのだろう。` the second part is a bit weird, I don't get it? Need to try again

"Hey, Kai? I guess even you don't have map of this place?"

Asked Saki, with a gun under her arm.

"Since the true world and stuff like that, I thought you'd know everything."

"I'm not that knowledgable, you know? Besides..."

But he didn't finish his sentence.
Hearing it, the elf, who sat besides him, could receive unimaginable shock.
Thinking like that, these words stuck in his throat.

In the true world, Ciel Mir forest doesn't exist.

It was burned down completely.
During the Great War majority of the forest was burned in battles.
Moreover with disappearance of foreign gods, who was managing the forest, ecosystem became wrecked.

In the true world there was no longer any forest.

_TL Note_: When referring to Ciel Mir, sensei is using `樹海` which could be literally translated as sea of trees, but I use just `forest`

![Reiren and Rinne](./p043.jpg)

_Humanity's triumph in the Great War belongs to the true history._

_But it is not all that good. For example this forest._

The forest, that remained standing in this world, made Kai to feel conflicted.
For hundred of thousands species that were living in the largest in the world forest, rather than a world, where humanity won, the current world is much more desirable.

[All units, report: is everything in order?]

Jeanne radioed to all (cars) at once, from the cadillac, which was in the column's center.

[This forest has thousands of unknown to us animals and plants.
There are poisonous flowers meadows, and also butterflies that spread the poison.
Everyone be sure to report if you feel unwell or uncomfortable.]

"...Good grief, what a great commander."

Elven shrine maiden said, while folding her arms.
Commander Jeanne didn't end her communications with orders alone.
She would always end with words of appreciation for the work of her subordinates.
As she was likely spot the subtle anxiety.

As they were proceeding deeper into these unfamiliar lands...
If they'd lose their way, there would be no way to return.
She(Jeanne) understood the anxiety and fears of her subordinates, who were challenging such dangerous lands.

[Vanguard car, what is situation? Any changes?]

"Perfectly fine, as a matter of fact."

Reiren gave a prompt response.

"In first place, if the forest would be actually so dangerous, foreign gods wouldn't even approach it.
But oh well, thee can leave it to me.
Even I have no desire to get myself killed after all.
So I'm going to choose the safest route."

[Please do so.]

They could hear Jeanne's chuckle from radio.

[Want to check one thing.
Does this forest, Ciel Mir, goes all the way until Yurun in south?]

"Indeed so.
I also made a direct trip on foot.
At that time it took me around 7 days."

Even for elf, who was able to easily leap from branch to branch of the ancient tree, almost like flying, it took seven days.

It made him wonder just how big this maze of the forest was.
Hearing Reiren's answer astonished him.

[And with our current pace?]

"Ideally it should take us 3 days and 3 nights.
But along the way we should be able to find few fruits, edible by humans.
No need to worry about provisions."

[Understood. I suppose I should be thankful to the Dante for supplying us with brand new batteries.]

Io Resistance's base was at Cassiopeia, which was industrial city in past.

If it wouldn't be for plants that could supply their cars with new batteries, there would be no way for them to carry out their plan of traversing through this maze of the forest.

"With our current pace, we should be able to reach a stream, abundant with spring water, within 2 hours."

[So you heard her, my friends.
Our next break...]

"Kai, what is that thing?"

Rinne, who stretched her neck from the rear, pointed towards the front glass.

She was pointing towards the clearance between two ancient trees.
As it was still far away, it wasn't very clearly visible.

"Hm? Meaning?"

"There is something weird there.
There are many trees fallen down,
and even ground became messy."

"...What!?"

Unintentionally, he put more force to his grip.
As they were running straight towards the direction, which Rinne pointed, at that moment...

"Stop this thing!"

Elven shrine maiden grasped Kai's left hand and started pulling it. _TL Note:_ A bit of trivia: Japan is one of these countries where cars are right handed.

And as a stiff look appeared on hear face...

"What is that thing...!"

"Jeanne, stop. There is something ahead!"

All cars started to slow down at once.
Their wheels, stopping all of the sudden, blew up a pile of fallen laves, leaving them dancing in the air.

_TL TODO:_ `勢いよく回転していた車輪が止まった反動に噴き上げられて` The last `ni` is a bit weird as it rather sounds like wheels are blown up themself, but maybe it is just my lack of experience

"Rinne, just what kind of eyesight thee have? Being able to discover that before me..."

"Humph! I'm more useful to Kai than you."

Then Reiren and Rinne jumped out of the car.

"Kai, what's wrong? Did something happen?"

Jeanne appeared from cadillac behind them.
Besides her was the female bodyguard Farin, walking with already unsheathed sword.

"Rinne and Reiren spotted something.
Jeanne, you should wait here.
You should be ready to give order any time, if there is really something there."

Urza Resistance forces were about 150 people.
And as it was not yet clear what [was there], it was unwise to move all forces.

"Kai, it might be good idea to take it with you."

"Mm... Yeah, got it."

Rinne, who peered into driver window, pointed at black bayonet.
It was a general purpose assault bayonet [Drake Nail].
Looking similar to Drake's claw, it was a weapon, developed by MDA based on records from the Great War.

_Rinne tells me to take my weapon..._

_Is it dangerous to such extent?_

"You're going to get devoured there."

Ominous words escaped lips of elven shrine maiden.

"Since I'm used to walking the forest, I'll be leading the way.
Kai, Rinne, follow me."

The elf leaped towards ancient tree's root.

And then from root to root, just like locust, she easily repeated her jump with ease.
In the blink of eye, her figure started to disappear.

"Oi, Reiren, you're going too far ahead alone... Damn it."

He exchanged glances with Rinne.
And then grabbing the Drake Nail, he run after.

The forest was filled with piles of fallen leaves.
Having no idea what could be hidden behinds these ancient trees and brushes, Kai had to remain cautious while running.

"Kai, be careful, if thee step on this mushroom, thy foot going to be swollen"

"Uo!?"

"Ah, and that's tree bug too. Its bite can take off a finger."

"As I thought, this forest is just absurd..."

Comparing to the forest surrounding elven village, it was extremely big and strange natural system.
Still Kai wondered what would make the elf, who was supposed to be very knowledgable, to regard something as unnatural.

"Kai, it's here."

Reiren was beckoning him from the ancient tree.

_TL Note:_ I'm not really sure how author means `害` here?

"I suspect the evil being is no longer here.
Still do not relax.
I don't know where it could be hiding."

"What do you mean...?!
This is...!?"

A shiver went down his spine.
It became clear to him once Kai went around the ancient tree.

There were mowed down and devoured trees...

Dozens of fallen trees had their bark and branches chewed off with terrific strength.
On the ground were footsteps that looked like a hole.
These were absurdly large footprints.

_Magical beasts that we saw in demons den was certainly big, but..._

_This looks much worse than their wildness._

It looked like a raging storm passed here.

"Well then, I'm at a loss here.
Certainly I'm proud of being knowledgable about the forest, but..."

Said elven girl, who was surveying the traces of destruction with awkward expression on her face.

"I cannot fathom what could cause such ruckus.
Being able to mow down these ancient trees?
Just what sort of monster could do it?
There is certainly no living being like that in this forest."

"To me it looks like a giant dragon being raging though..."

"Huh? Wait a second, Kai, where do thee think we are?"

Elven shrine maiden spread her hands.

"This land belongs to foreign gods.
We're in the east of great continent, while cryptids like dragons reside in the west.
They are completely on opposite side of the continent."

"Sure, I know.
But are there any other race that are capable of such feat?"

"..."

Having enough strength to mow down the ancient tree.
And leave these gigantic footprints, smashing and destroying all plants.
There were no other race, possessing such destructive nature.

"I'm with Kai on this."

"Mm?"

"There is animal's scent."

This gigantic footprint is not easy to recognize because of muddy ground.
But as Rinne brought closer her face to it, she could feel traces of it.

"Feels like the cryptid.
Cannot say which kind, but I'm certain it is not the dragon."

"...Truly?"

The elf became speechless.
This way it meant that giant cryptid was able to trespass onto their, foreign gods, territory.
It was equal as to what humans would call, when burglar would enter their house.

"Then what about this cryptid size!?
If such thing would cross the border, then angels would definitely notice it!"

Among foreign gods who lived in the forest were elves, dwarves and fairies.
On other angels, who lived in their sky palaces, watched over the Io territory from the sky.
For Reiren it was obvious to place her faith in their watch.

"I might have idea about it.
On our way from Urza, we met a cryptid.
But at that time it was just a wyvern."

It was at the time when they departed from the capital of Urza, on their way to the Io.
On highway amidst snowy mountain range, they were suddenly attacked by it.

[...Kai, above! It is coming from the sky!]

[Wyvern!]

[What is meaning of it, isn't it supposed to be demon territory? Why cryptid is here!?]

"...In northern country? So you've been attacked by cryptids there?"

"I doubted my own eyes.
At that time we lost two cars in battle with it.
We were fortunate that it ended only with that."

Even now they were puzzled by goal of that cryptid, stepping onto Urza territory.

"Soon after Vanessa's defeat, we had Wyvern intrude upon Urza borders.
And now after Alfreyja's defeat.
The timing is quite similar I think."

"If cryptids are trespassing territories of other countries..."

Reiren made a grimace.
But while elven shrine maiden was lost in thought, he heard Jeanne's voice from the radio.

_TL TODO:_ `エルフの巫女が返事を探しあぐねている間に、通信機を経由してジャンヌの声が。` First part is a bit confusing, mostly because of `探しあぐねている`

[Kai, how is it?]

"We're doing all right here.
Jeanne, I think you can come here too.
It is just..."

The criminal behind this destruction already left.
As Kai was watching footprints, which were following deeper into the forest, he tightly grasped the radio.

"We might have hard time reaching the southern border."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a href="#Part2" id="Part2" class="Bookmark"></a>

The green maze was repainted by madder red colour.
Behind these thick leaves, sun could be seen going down to the horizon.
Before long the night has arrived.

_TL Note:_ Author uses `生い茂る葉の上では` here, which is hard to get right for me so I re-phrased.
But probably I need to come back to it.

"Did I not tell that forest's ecosystem changes as day and night?"

"Lots more incests appear. Also big sized animals I think.
These are rarely approaching our village, but once night falls fairies are always laying down animal repelling spell."

They were in the clearing.
Assembling the tent, near the stream with spring water.
As Kai was working on setting up the tent, Reiren was observing with curiosity.

By the way, nearby was Rinne, who was sitting doing nothing.

"Hey, Kai? Is it done yet? It is so boring that I'm feeling sleepy..."

"I'll finish soon."

She was like a kitten who wanted to play.
Comparing to such Rinne, Reiren, who was looking with a great curiosity at tents, set up by humans, looked like a loyal dog.

"Come to think of it... Reiren, you seem calm now."

"What are thee talking about?"

"Well, there are lots of humans around.
Considering you've been sent with us as representative of the elven village, I expected you'd be complaining a lot...
Really, thanks."

Rinne and Reiren.
Both looked like a fairly skinned beautiful maidens.
As long as neither Rinne's wing or Reiren's ears are discovered, no one would suspect a thing.

"If I'd be on guard always, it would only make me suspicious, don't you think?"

Elven shrine maiden didn't even bat an eye at soldier, who passed by her back just now.
In such situation where she was surrounded by more hundred of enemies.

_TL Note:_ Ehm... Technically they are in truce though?

"That's why I restrain myself.
In all reality I want to fuss and complain about it."

"Well, I understand..."

"Still, it is hard for me to tolerate getting myself stained by human smell.
I shall take a stroll in the forest."

But before the elven girl, who stood up, turned her back towards them.

"Wait. Rinne, how about you tagging along with her?"

"Me?"

"...Still has no trust in me?"

Elven shrine maiden, who stood besides blankly blinking Rinne, frowned.

"Or do thee think I'll be up to no good, the moment thy eyes are averted?"

"It is simple: we saw the destruction during the day, didn't we?"

"...Mu."

"I want you to take a look around tent's surroundings.
If it is both of you, then it should be fine, is it not?"

It wasn't a matter of trust.
It was the opposite.
Precisely because elven knowledge was so highly valuable, she has been asked to patrol the surroundings after sunset, which would extremely dangerous task for Resistance's soldiers otherwise.

_TL Note:_ The last sentence is re-phrased.

"That is to say, this place is quite far away from these footprints, right?"

"They can cover one thousand and five hundred kilometres per day."

"?"

"From the known to me records: cryptids were able to perform assault of the city which was 1,500 kilometres away.
So to say these guys are able to traverse this much by just running over ground."

In the end cryptids are just enormous.
Therefore their sense of distance is different.
What would be like one kilometre for the human or the elf, wouldn't feel more than few meters to them.

_From that place it takes 3 hours on car._

_Even if it is more than 100 kilometres of straight path, we cannot be careless._

"It cannot hurt to be vigilant, don't you think?"

"I understand. Thee are such sort of human, after all."

Elven shrine maiden squinted.
Which looked as she was amused by him.

"It would seem it is me who wasn't taking thee seriously...
Hey, Rinne, let us go now.
Time to patrol."

"Yup, Kai, I'll be back soon."

Just like that with light footsteps, both girls headed into darkness of the forest in front of Kai's eyes.

_TL Note:_ `軽やかに宙を舞う` This is a bit hard to phrase, because I'm pretty sure it is not dance, but more like walking posture that resembles dancing? But how to name it?

"...Well, I'll continue setting up the tent then."

He finished putting anti-wind cover onto the tent.
But the moment he was about to move on the second one...

"Kai."

Jeanne, who appeared from behind, patted his shoulder.

"Did you see Reiren?"

"She went on lookout with Rinne, you wanted something from her?"

"No, it is fine then.
I was about to ask her to do the same thing actually.
And if Rinne is with her then she will not be able to pull any tricks so easily."

This was inevitable.
Jeanne's worry was also in line with Reiren own words few moments ago.

[Foreign gods keep their promises.]

So they would abide by their one year truce agreement, and Reiren was sent to accompany them for that purpose.
This is what elven elder told them, but Kai couldn't trust these words completely.

_From foreign gods point of view, humans are just inferior._

_So do they even intend to keep their promise with such humans... Jeanne's worry is natural._

There was no way to know when Reiren would just run away.
What makes Jeanne's wariness even more stronger is her duty as the Commander over more than hundred people, which was only natural.

"And, Kai, I'd like us to chat a bit."

"Us...?"

"Just us yes. It would be hard if my subordinates would hear us so let move back."

They moved towards the ancient tree, illuminated by a campfire.
Brushes behind it wouldn't be too far from the tent, but far enough so that no one would hear them.

"Here should be fine... Now that I think about it: We didn't have chance to talk much about it."

She changed from her energetic male voice to lovely and charming female one.
As she always keep herself disguised as a male commander she had to keep her voice as <span title="Not volume, but as if male's low voice">low sounding</span>.
But in front of Kai she could return back to her natural voice.

"About your sword."

She pointed at the Drake Nail, which was in holster on his back.

"When we fought Alfreyja, it looked to me like it was emitting light and then changing it's shape."

"Yeah, it wasn't your imagination."

"...I was wondering what sort of weapon is it?"

This weapon wasn't work of humans.
It was pretty obvious to Jeanne's eyes.
And it was obviously different from bayonet, which was indeed human's invention.

Code Holder.

It was the sword, which he found in [Demons Graveyard] where he once found himself lost.

"Even I don't know about it. I only picked it up."

"Eh?"

"I told before: in known to me history there was a human known as Sid."

"...I heard yeah. Sid was the one who brought us victory in the great war.
In history of your world that is."

"This Code Holder is said to be the sword that Sid wielded.
Although right now it is bayonet, but probably it will materialize in response to my voice.
How it works though is beyond me."

He always wondered why Sid's sword would end up in the graveyard.
And Kai's question was answered by demons hero Vanessa.

[Sid foresaw that something strange is going to happen with world.]

[Sid left this sword to me. In anticipation to this situation...]

Ability to severe the fate.
This was the power of this sword, and the only thing that Kai knew about it.

"Doesn't sound reliable." _TL Note:_ I'm a bit uncertain what `危うい` is referring to.

Silver haired commander made a sullen face.

`助けられた私が言うのはお門違いかもしれないけど、よく知りもしない武器を使うのは感心しないわ。ソレ、人間の武器じゃないんでしょ？`
