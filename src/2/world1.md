"Kay...Kay, Kay, where are you!?"

Government Palace.
In heart of vast Urza Federation, stood twin tower, which was symbol of capital.
There on first floor, could be heard lovely female voice.

"Kay...?"

"You don't need to shout so much, I'm here."

There, in front of elevator on first floor, which hasn't been used for last 30 years, was young man who was working on cleaning it out of dust and fixing cables.
Stopping his repairs, Kay wiped sweat from his forehead with his hand.
His name was Kay Sakuravent.
It was 17 years old young man whose hair and eyes had colour of dark ultramarine.
He was wearing MDA uniform, which was mass-produced uniform for anti four races activities.
Results of daily training were clearly visible on his body.

"What is it, Rinne?"

"! Ah, you're here Kay...!"

Seeing him, blond hair girl expression immediately became brighter.
Her name was Rinne.
She had pair of jade green eyes, and her pale golden hair shook as she run.
Her flustered cheeks added even more charm to her lovely features.
Although she was quite slender, her chest gave off feminine allure.
And her waist curves were clearly visible in these thing clothes.
From her outward appearance she looked like 16 years old girl.
But her actual age wasn't known even to Rinne herself.
This young lady had mixed blood of all other races.
And now this girl, raised overhead the towel that she supposed to use to wipe windows.

"Kay, big trouble! Really big trouble!"

"Eh? I'm certain you were only asked to help with some cleaning."

"Yeah, that's right! Come, come here!"

Rinne pulled her hand with towel behind.
And there Kay could see cracks on window.
Total of four cracks looked like a spider web.

"Oh, is it broken? How strange, I'm pretty sure we replaced it with new."

"It is already been broken when I was planning to wipe it clean."

"...I see."

Kay looked at towel that Rinne was holding, and then at cracked window.

"It seems there are drops of water on glass, as if left towel."

"Ah!?"

Blond girl made small scream and put behind the towel.

"It-t is not me, you know? I'm not the one who broke glass."

"...So you put too much force when you tried to wipe window?"

Rinne was mixed of multiple races.
Thanks to her dragon and beast ancestry, despite her delicate appearance, she had so much physical strength, that one would wonder just from where these slender arms could draw it.
And since she is not used to the job, it is quite possible for her to break glass by mistake.
While Kay was thinking so...

"N-no..."

Rinne shook her head horizontally over and over again.

"When I came here it is already been broke.
I'm sure that culprit is someone among Resistance soldiers.
These humans, cleaning there, are likely to be the one at fault."

"Got it, I believe you, Rinne."

"Kay! Thank you!"

"By the way, Rinne, when glass broke it didn't injury you?
It would be bad if some fragments would sunk in."

"It is all right, instance it broke, I pulled my hand away... Ah..."

"I see, so you broke it."

Before Kay who was nodding, Rinne smile instantly froze.

"Rinne."

"..."

She just looked at him with upturned eyes, as if wanting to say something.
But in the middle of it she swallowed her breath.
And finally she replied.

![Rinne oopsie](./p017.jpg)

"...I'm sorry."

"As long as you understand."

"...Hey, Kay? You're angry?"

"Hm... Let's see."

"...A-after all you're angry, right?"

"Since you honestly apologized, this time I'm not."

"! As expected, I like you Kay!"

Kay made strained smile seeing Rinne jumping from happiness.
Losing window like that is certainly wasteful, but he couldn't bring himself to seriously scold her.
Thanks to Kay and Rinne they were able to retake Government Palace from demons.
Seven days ago...
Here was fight against demons in order to take it back, and deadly battle against Dark Empress Vanessa.
If it wouldn't be for Rinne's strength, they'd be unlikely to accomplish their goals

"I'm going to tell Jeanne. Pretty sure we should have some spare glass for window."

"Jeannya?"

"It is Jeanne. Rinne, wanna come with me?"

"Nope, don't wanna.
In that conference room is too many humans.
Here first floor is big so it is less crowded with humans.
I'm fine here."

Rinne was frowning.
Being different from other races, she had past of being oppressed by all races, including humans.
Other than Kay, who was special to her as he saved her, she had hard time dealing with humans.
She had wings that was mix of angel's and demon's.
Under her golder hair pointy elven ears were hidden.
Even though she could hide her wings under clothes, if someone aside from Kay would see it, that would cause uproar.

"Got it, I'll go find Jeanne, you can rest here."

"Yes!"

"While I'm away I prohibit you to break stuff."

"Yup, if Kay says so, I'm not going to."

One could only wonder what would happen if he didn't say so.
And while Kay imagined what would happen, Rinne smiled and just looked at him.
But against her lovely and pure smile, Kay had no chance to win.

"Have a nice trip."

"I'll be back soon."

Kay turned away from Rinne.
He decided to use elevator, which he just fixed, and go to 10th floor.

"It works...
But, well, after all I cannot get used to it.
Am I just happy that a single elevator finally works?
The world I'm in right now..."

While riding elevator, Kay leaned against cold wall and was looking at ceiling.

"...I'm going to return make it as the world I remember.
In your place, Sid."

One day, World [Overwrite] happened.
Before <ruby>young man<rt>Kay</rt></ruby> eyes the world history has been overwritten by [World Reincarnation]
Just like abound hundred years ago, the history of Kay's world repeats itself in deadly conflict for hegemony among five races.
Five Races Great War.
In this war hero Sid led humanity to victory.
As four other races were crushed, humanity sealed them away in remote regions.
Or at least that's what supposed to be.

Hero [Dark Empress] Vanessa who leads, demon race, wielders of powerful magic.

Hero [Heaven Lord] Alfreya who leads foreign gods, composed of angels and elfs.

Hero [Spirit Sovereign] Rokugen Kyouko who leads spirits, very peculiar creatures like ghosts.

Hero [Fag King] Rath=IE who leads cryptids, gigantic and ferocious beasts.

But...
