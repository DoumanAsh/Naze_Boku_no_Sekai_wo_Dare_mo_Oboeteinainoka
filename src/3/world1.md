There was standing a solemn ancient tree.
Being several hundred years old, this tree had growth so much that it looked like it was piercing heavens itself.
It had countless branches, it's thick leafs were still fresh and it still emitted wild fragrance.

Elven forest...
The place where this several hundred years ancient tree was standing, and in any direction you could see captivating scenery.

"I've been mindlessly walking through it up until now, but calming down and taking a proper look. This forest is great."

Said the young man who was sitting on tree's roots.
With black bayonet "Drake Nail" by his side, Kai was squinting at dazzling sunlight filtering through tree.

His name was Kai Sakuravent.
It was a young mane of age 17, with hair and eyes of dark ultramarine colour.
He was wearing MDA's battle suit, mass produces garments for soldiers purpose of fighting against other races,
under it was a body, trained countless days, radiating a certain strength.

"As one would expect from Io's unexplored region..."

The forest, where Kai was currently in, was a territory of race, called foreign gods.
Which was composed of elves, dwarves, fairies and angels.
Far wiser that humans, and the one who possessed magic tools, which were far more powerful than human weaponry.
Often called as a [better version of humans].
And on this land, humans had been dominated by foreign gods for over hundred years.

But right now...
Foreign gods showed no hostility towards humans, who entered the forest.
Across the forest could be heard birds chirps, and there were no signs of ferocious animals.
It was a calm and relaxing place.
A true tranquillity.

"Kai, you've been resting here?"

He looked at the brushes.
Silver haired girl, clad in light armour, peeked at him from within animal trail.
Her name was Jeanne.
She had beautiful and dignified face.
Her long silver hair was tied behind, and together with her tall figure, made her look a bit boyish.
While being just seventeen, as Kai, she was leader of single Resistance Army.

"Didn't you say you were going to look for Reiren?
That's not really good to laze around here, while everyone are preparing for our next expedition."

"I'm waiting for Rinne, she is the one who went to look for Reiren."

He wasn't lazing around around.
Saying so, Kai jumped from the root, on which he was sitting.

"Eh, Rinne? I'm kinda worried if she hasn't gotten lost..."

"Don't worry, when it comes to Rinne, she can quickly..."

_TL Note:_ TODO `リンネなら俺がどこにいてもすぐ──` I'm not sure how to re-order sentence to not miss the port about Kay's place

"Quickly?"

"...She'll come back for sure.
Rinne already gotten used exploring this forest."

Kai wondered how Jeanne would react, if he'd just say that Rinne could pin down Kai's location with her nose.

The girl, named Rinne, was in fact non-human.
She had mix of blood from various human enemies.
But among humans only Kai was aware of it.

"By the way, Jeanne, weren't you supposed to attend a meeting in the village?"

"That's right.
Together with angels...
Anyway, the elven elder got tired of waiting, just where is our Reiren?"

"Well then how about I'll go to bring her?
I remember which direction, Rinne took."

He pointed towards brushes deep in the forest.

"Jeanne, are you going back?"

"No, I'll tag along.
I've been sitting the whole time while in discussion with foreign gods, my body feels stiff.
So I feel like to take a short walk."

They walked through animal trail.
And while moving forward with withered grass under their foot.

"Just now, I heard quite surprising story from elves."

He wanted to ask what, but before that Jeanne made a sigh and continued.

"So for foreign gods it might be normal to sit down for about a month without eating anything when they have serious discussion.
Carry on, without sleeping or even a single drop of water."

"I cannot imagine."

"Yeah, hearing it made me shiver.
And we were fighting against race that could calmly talk about something like that."

A bitter smile appeared on female commander face.

"Until now humans were not able to stand up against them.
We're fundamentally different when it comes to our <span title="jp. 生命力 (life force) - I'm a bit unsure about exact meaning here.">vitality</span>
After all our lifespan is tenfold shorter.
To be honest, I'm really relieved that we were able to manage the cease-fire."

"...Yeah."

As Kai agreed with her, it reminded him about single demon, with whom he had a deal.
It happened far north.
In vast Urza, which is controlled by demons, shortly after Kai was able to take back the capital.
All of the sudden, that succubus queen appeared.

[Don't get carried away.
It was miracle after another that you were able to defeat onee-sama,
Still If three of us would remain here at capital, you'd have no chance of winning.]

She was succubus queen Hinemarill.
And number two among demons.
Her pressure was close to that of Vanessa's.

After fierce battle Kai was able to defeat the dark empress.
So he hoped it would finally reverse the scale between humans and demons.
But at that very moment he realized that he was wrong.

"Without a doubt, we got lucky.
It might really that we only barely won."

"...Right. It was going too smoothly up until now."

Jeanne's expression stiffened.

"In Urza, thanks to Kai we were able to take back the capital alone.
But the rest of it is still under demons control.
As for Io... Well.
It was only because of Alfreyja's rampage that we ended up cooperating with foreign gods.
Either way, both remain strong."

Both demons and foreign gods.
Even though their respective heroes were lost, they were able to retain their strength.

_With demons we got only promise of non-interference for arbitary time._

_With foreign gods we attained one year cease-fire agreement._

Both had own merits and demerits.
The non-interference promise with demons could continue for several years, but no one knew when it is going to end.
With foreign gods they were able to conclude concrete cease-fire agreement, but it is only for a mere year.

"Let us not lose our focus.
Up until now it is been going so smooth, that my subordinates are starting to feel restless.
But overconfidence is going to get us hurt."

"I'll leave that to you, Jeanne.
Let's see, I think it is this way."

They went after Rinne, who still hasn't come back.
Going deeper into the forest.
Even though he told her not to venture too far away.

"Rinne. Hey, Rinne, where are you?"

Jumping over roots, which were reaching his knees, Kai carried on the animal trail.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_TL Note:_ Reiren POV

The forest with ancient tree.
This forest became a dwelling place of elves 200 years before.
Originally dwelling place of fairies, elves came settled here after dwarves.
Here, in the spring, full of crystal clear water...

"..."

Water splashed.
In this transparently clear water, single figure of elf was floating face up.
Her figure looked like that of small human girl.
With her eyes closed from dazzling sunlight filtering through the forest, her beautiful azure hair was vividly spread on water's surface.
Moreover her almost transparently white skin made her even more beautiful.

_TL Note:_ I think we need some illustrations here...

But...

"AAh! Damn, what's with this!"

Ruining this beautiful scenery, the elven girl all of the sudden get up, while her angry scream echoed throughout the forest.

"I'm elven shrine maiden!
More then few hundred years I've been performing rites in this forest.
Even though I've been called with respect by my brethren as [shrine maiden-sama], why ought I to accompany humans in their expedition!"

Big splash of water arise.
The elf reveal her anger and starts hitting water's surface with both her hands time and time again.

"...Huh...Huh...Uh...N-not good.
For me of all people...
I came to bathe to calm myself, and instead my heart became even more agitated."

It had completely opposite effect.
She came to soak in cold water in order to clear her head, but instead she had a vivid recollection of her memories.

"Compose... Compose yourself...
The reason behind a rift among us...
Alfreyja-dono is the reason behind it after all..."

The main cause of everything is what happened few weeks ago.
For long living races like elves, it is not much different from just memories of yesterday.
She was able to clearly recall it.

[Everyone except me.
First I ought burn down all corrupted foreign gods who walk the ground.]

Who could believe that these would be a words, spoken by foreign gods hero.
It was obvious that at that time heaven lord Alfreyja lost his mind.
Whether it was brainwashing or confuse.
Reiren couldn't possibly know details behind it.
But she had idea of who could be a culprit.

"..."

Her long azure hair spread throughout a water like a stream.
Putting the hand on her <span title="凹凸の控えめな胸元 - I'm not sure why author needs to put such accent here">moderate</span> chest.
Elven shrine maiden clenched her teeth.

_TL Note:_ `深い森のなか奥歯` I don't get this one

"...Patience. I have to accompany these humans for the sake of vengeance for Alfreyja-dono.
I already resolved to make this detestable beast to realize the gravity of his crime."

The one who caused heaven lord Alfreyja to change.
It was highly likely that the culprit behind it was the [Fang King] Rath=IE.
And it was a duty, bestowed upon Reiren, to ascertain it with her own eyes.

"That's right. It is a honourable mission for foreign gods.
So accompanying humans, so to speak, is a honourable duty to become elves representative...
Right, if I'd think about it like that..."

_TL Note:_ Talk about escaping reality...

"Hey, hey?"

"Hh-yaa!? W-what is it!"

It almost made her to cream, and then Reiren turned over.
Cold hand, wet in water, which reached her back now touched her cheek.
Of course she raised her voice because of sudden touch from cold hand, rather than being surprised.

"...Mu. As I remember you're Rinne."

"Yup."

Reiren wondered when she came to this spring.
Before her was a golden haired girl, her body up to chest being under water.
On the bank of the spring could be seen her clothes, it would seem that this girl swam all the way here.

"It feels so good.
This water, it is spring water, right?
Cold, but so pretty.
And there is even small fish swimming around."

"U-umu.
It is filtered water from within underground after all.
For every living creature in the forest this is a watering place, with abundance of clear water....
Wait, no, that's not it!"

She waved her hand and pointed towards Rinne in front of her.

"W-why thee is here!?"

"Cuz I searched for you. Kai was looking for you."

"...Mu. That guy?"

Which reminded her that there was indeed some talk during cease-fire agreement about deciding on some minor details of their cooperation.
She was so absorbed in her bathing, that she completely forget about time.

"Understood, I'm coming.
Hey, thee too come out of the spring."

"Can I swim here?"

"No way."

Her answer came instantly.

"This is a bathing place for elves only, therefore other races are not allowed."

"Muu!"

Rinne was pouting.

"I hate such things.
Things like race, I don't like it."

"Race is race after all. It cannot be helped..."

She started saying, but stopped.
The reason for Reiren's hesitation was seeing Rinne's white and silk like skin, that wouldn't lose to her own.
Her skin looked like that of elves.

Then on her back could be seen tenma wings, which usually were hidden.
At their roots wings were black, but closer to edges they were becoming white.
Roots were that of demons, while edges were of angels.
Even though she already heard about it, it was actually first time seeing it with her own eyes.

"...Oi, Rinne?"

"What?"

"Bear with me for a moment."

She nervously extended her hands.
Touching these wings gave a similar feeling to that of angel wings.
It wasn't just looking like angel wings, but now she thought it was exactly the angel wings.

"A-ahaha, stop it is ticklish!"

"Mu... Colour is good, touching feels the same. They are exactly like that of angel."

Both angels and elves belonged to foreign gods race.
So she wondered if that's the case then wouldn't the girl with elven skin and angel wings belong to the same race.
But the answer was no.
Reiren noticed few other scents from this girl.
Of demons, of spirits, of cryptids.
Furthermore there was something else.

She was unidentifiable girl with mix of various races.

"Thee..."

While touching girl's wings, she continued gazing at the girl.

"This is quite a good opportunity.
Tell me honestly, just who are thee?
Why thee tags along the Kai?"

"Dunno."

"What?"

"Just who am I?
Even I don't know that.
And Kai told me to [come together] so I'm with him."

The golder haired girl, who answered with that, brightened up.
Reiren wondered whether she'd be angry or upset about the question.
But contrary to her expectations Rinne gave her answer while placing her hand on her chest with pride.

"Kai told me [it is fine to be together] himself too.
Regardless of who says what I don't mind it."

"..."

"That's it is fine for me to swim in this spring. It is my freedom!"

"Such leap of logic is just too much, don't you think!?"

Reiren grasped with her hand hair of Rinne who was swimming.

"Ai? W-what are you doing damn elf!"

"I just told thee, this is the bathing place for elves only.
No other race can use it."

"It is fine! I got some elven blood in me."

With her hand on bouncing blossom Rinne objected.
Indeed Reiren could see from the pure white skin, that Rinne got some elven blood in her.
But...

_TL Note:_ For some reason sensei started to put some accent on these peculiar details about girls chests :)

"<span title="I'm not even going to try to change it">Hohou</span>?
Then what about this!
This uselessly big chest and ass!
Elves got no such obscene bodies."

Reiren pointed her finger on Rinne's left breast.
Almost as if sinking it into this softness, it gave profound and heavy feeling of flesh.

"Kya? W-what are you doing!"

"Just look at it!
Thy chest is not like that of elves.
Our, elves, bodies are far more modest for both woman and man.
It is our virtue."

Figures of both male and female elves tend to be slender, with a little apparent difference.
Males hardly develop big muscle mass, while females never have big hips or chest like human woman.

From Reiren point of view, Rinne's body was [too ripe].
She suspected it might be influence of human blood, or maybe from demon succubus.

"How obscene!"

"I-it is not obscene! You damn elf just got it [no-existing] that's all!"

"Wha!?"

The one who claimed to be modest, got her quite modest chest under Rinne's gaze.
This time it was Reiren turn to shrink back.

"What are thee saying!
It might look like that, but I'm quite confident about my body.
My body, which has no unnecessary meat, is in fact the best!"

"It is flat!"

"What is wrong with being flat!?"

_TL Note:_ Oi, Rinne did you get bulling license on our flat goddess!?

Rising her both hands above the head, she poured spring's water onto Rinne's face.

"You, now you done it! Damn flat elf!"

"Are you still saying it, damn mixed race!
Thy body is just too obscene!"

While soaking into spring water, they were glaring at each other.
Then, brushes shook and both girls quickly caught on who it might be.

"Hey, Rinne? Reiren, are you there?"

Pushing aside brushes, appeared young man with ultramarine hair.

"Ah, there you are. So you've been here all this...."

Appearing out of brushes in front of girls, that he was looking, Kai shown relief on his face, but soon enough his smiling face froze.
He looking back and forth between the clothes of two girls on the bank side, and the girls themself soaking in cold water.

"..Ah, s-sorry! I didn't mean..."

"Kai, how is it? Did you find them?"

Following Kai appeared silver haired girl Jeanne.
Under sunlight both girls were exposed stark naked, and then there was Kai, who was standing in close proximity to these girls.

"Kai..."

Jeanne's gentle face soon became clouded by heavy glare.

"To think the reason you wanted to come to look for them...
Is to peek on them while they are bathing."

"Even for misunderstanding, isn't a bit too much!?"

Deep within the elven forest.
The lone scream of falsely accused young man echoed.

<br>
<br>

One day, the world has been [overwritten].
Before Kai own eyes, the history itself has been re-written by [World Reincarnation]...

Kai remembered it.
In his true world, hundred years ago five races fought to a bitter end over world domination.
It was Five Races Great War.
And the victor in this war was humanity, with [prophet] Sid as their leader.
Sid crushed four other races and sealed them away in remote regions.

But...
This history disappeared all of the sudden.
Instead it became a reverse.
It became a history where [humanity has been defeated in great war].

Hero [Dark Empress] Vanessa, who led demons, wielders of powerful magic.

Hero [Heaven Lord] Alfreyja, who led foreign gods alliance, composed of angels and elves.

Hero [Spirit Sovereign] Rikugen Kyouko, who led spirits, ghost-like existence.

Hero [Fang King] Rath=IE, who led cryptids, enormous and ferocious beasts.

Four races now controlled the world.
And mankind, who barely managed to escape eyes of these four races, was now struggling to survive by hiding in remote regions, ruins of old buildings or underground.
This was a current state of [overwritten] world.

_Only me and Rinne remember the true world._

_Other than no one remembers it._

Then there was Kai himself.
In this over-written world, he himself, as well as the hero no longer existed.
It was unclear whether his parents or relatives exist there.
And both his superiors and colleagues from previous world no longer remembered him.

Being in such hopeless situation...

"I do not mind it at all though?
It doesn't bother me to show myself naked in front of a human."

"I'm fine too. If it is Kai, I can show him anything."

"Umu, not intending to treat Kai somewhat special, but I'm of a different race.
For humans it is perfectly fine to see naked dog or cat, after all?"

They paid no heed to Kai's suffering.
Reiren and Rinne just talked carefreely.

"Jeanne, are you going to fussy over small thing?" _TL Note:_ Reiren

"...Listen, put on some clothes already.
It is matter of how you look.
Elven body is quite similar to that of humans."

Kai had turn away to now watch both of them changing.
And Jeanne kept watch on Kai to make sure he is not going to turn back.

"Also, Reiren, give me a bit of your time once you finish changing.
I have something to talk about.
I'm sure you know what about?"

"Of course, it is expedition's matter.
I came here to cleanse myself in order to prepare for that."

Reiren, who finished changing, was now in her seventh layered silk garments.
This was elven magic tool.
Once activated, each of these layers could act as powerful protective barrier.

"I'm going to accompany thee as representative of foreign gods.
And in order to avenge Alfreyja-dono we're going to attack western country, where cryptids are.
Right?"

"Yeah, but..."

Looking back at the elf, who was looking up at her, female commander of Urza Resistance answered with all seriousness.

"We're heading to the South, not the West.
We're heading to Yurun country on the South, which is now Spirits domain."

"Wha!?"

It was completely different story for her.
But before shrine maiden could rise her objection, Kai continued after Jeanne.

"That's why I came here looking for you.
To let you know what elven elder said."

"I heard nothing of it though?"

"Someone was enjoying her bath, while we discussed it.
And we already got it decided."

"...Mu. That's... Well..."

"I'll tell you the reason on our way, let us return quickly."

He gave a silent cue to Rinne, who finished changing.
Kai pointed towards the animal trail, that led to the village, and walked deep into the ancient forest.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Io Federation...
It is a big country in eastern part of the continent and at the moment being under control of foreign gods.
Humans, who lost in the war, had to reconstruct ruins into cities and live in hiding, scraping by.
Each of 18 human cities is guarded by Resistance soldiers, which serve as defence for people from foreign gods invasion.

Headquarters of the Resistance was in 8th ward Cassiopeia.
It was a site of once large scale factory, and in one of the areas there...

"Jeanne-dono, are you about to depart...?"

In the office for commanding officers.
There were 3 man and woman standing in this room, with curtain obscuring sunlight.
It was the elderly soldier, standing in center, who addressed the Jeanne.
He was a staff officer, Tsekhman.
A man who serves as right hand to Io Resistance's Commander.

"Isn't it too early?" _TL Note:_ Is it continuation of Tsekhman dialogue?

"Jeanne-sama made her decision.
Our, Urza Resistance, morale is at its peak.
To suggest not to continue our expedition..."

Face to face with the old soldier was Fairin, one of the Urza Resistance top brass.
Normally being by Jeanne's side as her guard, right now she had to separate with her master, in order to inform them.

"And the reason...
Defeating Vanessa in Urza and making demon to leave you alone.
And now achieving cease-fire agreement with foreign gods.
You do not want to lose your momentum here?"

"That's right. However..."

Said Commander's bodyguard Fairin.
And then Urza strongest female warrior continued with husky voice...

"Jeanne-sama is concerned.
Up until now it is been going too smooth."

"..."

"Even with the loss of Vanessa, demons remain strong.
And then cease-fire with foreign gods too, wasn't result of actual victory in war, but instead they suggested it themself."

"That's..."

"What a unlovely boring response."

Behind old soldier, a plump man turned away from a window, slowly turning towards Fairin.

"Reclaiming Urza's capital, and then achieving truce with foreign gods in this country...
Despite achieving so much, he has no intention to relax even a bit?"

"Indeed. And I share the same opinion.
And as for remaining two heroes, we ought to remain vigilant."

"How wise of you."

Said Commander Dante, who looked like a bored child.
This self-proclaimed emperor was known to be a lump of conceit and pride.
He had ambition to become a hero, leading the mankind, but instead foreign gods used it against him and let him taste humiliation of being taken a prisoner.
And the one who freed this Dante was Jeanne.

Even though he was thankful to his rival for saving his life, but just admitting achievements of the rival was a annoyance for him.
And that was his current state of mind.

"It seems Jeanne is planning heading south, to Yurun."

"Yes."

"Spirits are quite troublesome bunch.
Even now we still have no idea how these eerie spirits live.
The same about how to deal with them.
And on top of that we cannot talk with them."

What it meant... Is that truce is not possible.
They do not posses intelligence that would make them temporarily retreat like demons,
or seeking a peace like foreign gods.
The kind of species that would fight until the very end.

"How are you planning to drive away these monsters?"

"South Yurun Resistance Army Commander is acquaintance of mine."

Fairin replied.
And the staff officer, who raised his eyebrow at her words, said:

"Lion King Balmung?"

"Yeah, I've been indebted to him. Hopefully he still remembers me."

Fairin faintly smiled.
It was quite rare for this female soldier, who remained cold as steel, to show such emotions.

"I have no doubt that he is a great commander."

"Quite different from me, right?"

Once again Dante lamented.

"Me and Jeanne failed to establish cooperative relationships after all.
So to avoid repeating this mistake, you decided to head the country with more reliable commander, something like that?"

"I wouldn't dare."

"Stop it. The only possible reason for you to choose Yurun as your next destination can be only it.
This time you want to establish allied front between two resistance armies and fight against spirits together."

"..."

"Jeanne, indeed, was able to take demons by surprise.
But now two remaining races should become more wary of humans.
This time you will not be able to surprise them.
However mankind would be at disadvantage in full-fledged war.
The chances of victory are quite slim unless you ally with fellow comrades."

Therefore they are planning to head to south, where they can find reliable commander.
That was Jeanne's plan.

"Am I not right?"

"...It is a pity." _TL Note:_ This `……惜しいですね` is a bit unclear, but I think she actually means that Dante's wits are wasted on him?

Fairin chuckled.
It was simply her way to express admiration for Dante's insight.

"Commander Dante, it might be rude, but I'd like to say one thing."

"Go ahead."

"You certainly have talent to see through the situation.
If you'd be able to throw away your cheap pride and seriously behave yourself as a commander, then I believe you'd really be able to take a role of the leader for humanity."

Or even if not in a commander's role, but as officer, he'd be able to leave a mark on history.

"It is still not too late.
How about using your wits for a real purpose?"

"...Humph."

Plump commander turned his back towards her.

"Tell Jeanne this.
If he'll get audience bored with this pretence of being a leader of humanity,
soon enough I'll drag him down and stand on the stage myself."

"Understood."

"That will be all.
As a farewell gift, I'll grant you provisions and ammunition."

Bowing towards Dante, who quickly finished saying his piece, and giving small nod towards the old soldier, Jeanne's bodyguard turned back.

Two days later.
Urza Resistance Army, led by Jeanne, departed towards the south.
