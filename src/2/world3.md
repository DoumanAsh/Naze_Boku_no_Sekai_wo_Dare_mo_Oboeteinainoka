Continent's eastern part -
Third of it is covered by mountains, while the remaining parts are assumed to be covered by forests.
The reason for it to be assumption is quite simple.
It was one of [unexplored regions] which humans are yet to step on and investigate.
Taking as example world's largest forest <span title="jp. シィエル・ミ">Ciel Mi</span>, humanity only investigate at most 20% of it.
There are even reports indicating that there dozens of undiscovered animals, insects and plants.
And this gigantic sea of trees is current domain of Foreign gods.

"Angels built themself palace above clouds,
Fairies set up themself a village near beautiful lake,
Elfs and dwarfs made forest itself their home...
Well that's what I heard though."

Said Ashlan, while trying to recall it.
As they were driving through ruins of small buildings, the car had to slow down to avoid damaging wheels from all of the rubble lying down.

"In fact, foreign gods doesn't seem to like human cities.
Contrary to demons, they do not live in human settlements at all."
