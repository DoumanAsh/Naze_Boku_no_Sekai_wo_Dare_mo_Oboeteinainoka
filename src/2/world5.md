Depths of elven forest.
Animal trail, which was illuminated by deep green sunlight.
Fairin, who stopped on the road, turned off <span title="jp. 通信機 From now on just radio">radio<span>.

"Jeanne-sama, I've finished contacting our unit at the forest's entrance."

"How is it?"

"While it is now hard to get through due to distance, but I was able to report that we're safe.
I also requested Io communication unit to work on bettering communications."

"...We'd have to report our triumph after all."

Jeanne tightened her lips.
Their report this morning was to ensure that it wouldn't be their last call.
They had to complete their end of deal with elves, retrieve Dante alongside his subordinates and return bakc.

"Is rest already over?"

Elven shrine maiden Reiren, who was sitting on ancient tree's root, asked.

"Then let us proceed. We are almost upon our destination."

"...We've been walking for over 1 hour but, are we really so close?"

Kai called out her, who was about to turn her back to them.
His hand, on which shoulder he was carrying Drake Nail, was already sweating quite a lot.
They've been following through serpentine animal trails, thick areas filled with ancient trees and even crossing river within the forest.
Yet they still hadn't reached their destination.

"I think we should see angel palace now."

"I see it. Look."

Elven girl pointed above their heads.
The view was obstructed for the most part by branches of towering ancient tree,
and sky could be hardly seen from within a forest.

"Angel palace is up there.
The floating fortress on top of the ancient tree.
It is finest work of elves, dwarves and fairies.
Which we already told thee."

"...Above there?"

Shadow covered them from above.
He thought it was shadow of ancient tree, but he didn't expect it to be a shadow of angel palace.

"It is not the only floating fortress of angels.
However only this one is called angel palace.
Because Alfreya-dono is residing there...
Now, here it is."

Elven girl tore off leaf out of ancient tree.
And there was magical circle.
As she touched it, a huge magic circle of bright light have risen from the ground.
It was magic with double trigger.
Before one could activate the teleportation gate, they had to activate small hidden magic circle on tree's trunk.

"It might be a weird thing to ask for me, but is such complicated device is countermeasure against humans?"

"Well that's quite a question, isn't?
We are enemies then." _TL Note:_ I feel like I didn't express Reiren here well enough, but to be honest it is kinda difficult to get her meaning here `よくもまあ堂々と聞くものじゃ。ワシらは敵じゃぞ`

Girl, who stood on ancient tree's roots, turned towards him with bewildered look.
She answered with a faint smile.

"The answer is [Nay]. We hold no fear towards humans.
The only one we regard as dangerous are demons and cryptids, then spirits."

"Demons were the same, completely ignored humans."

"...Kai, I see what thee meant by this question.
If angels are not regarding humans as danger, then it is likely that inside palace there will not be many guards?"

"Yeah, besides angels are too placing majority of their floating fortress alongside Io national border."

The same attitude as that of Urza's demons.
They are focusing their power on borders as they are wary of invasion from other races.

_Then we have more than enough chances to return alive._

_After all the number of angels is definitely not big inside palace._

After securing elven elders, they would just escape before angels would come rushing in from other floating fortress.

"So thee shall return back alive?"

"Even you think the same, right?"

"But of course. As long as we are not discovered by Alfreya-dono.
I wouldn't take such measures otherwise.
Like this."

Elven girl used hood of her travelling attire to conceal her face.
Her figure was concealed by mantle.
As under it she had her seventh layered spirit garments it was quite big, but with such appearance it was difficult to recognize her as a elf.

She used special perfume to mask elven odour as that of human.
And put on necklace that suppressed her magic powers.

She erased all elven traces in her appearance.
And right now she looked just like human girl in travelling outfit.

"How is it?
With this even if angels would see me, they'd never think it is [elf who is guiding humans]."

"Yeah, then only humans are going to fight with angels.
And you'll remain neutral."

"That's right, we shall not assist angels and neither will look for opportunity to strike thee.
Elves will keep their promise."

Teleportation magic circle.
Elven girl stepped into light of so-called gate.

"Come, Kai, thee are first after all."

"Of course."

With Drake Nail in his hand, Kai lined up with the elf.

_If it is trap, then stepping in with everyone would meen our complete annihilation._

_I alone will confirm if it safe, and then others will come along._

It was decision they made last night.
If Drake Nail is loaded with elven bullets then it is capable of erasing magic power.
Moreover with Code Holder as his trump card, even if Kai would be surrounded by angels, he still would be able to fight against them.
That's why the scouting duty fell onto him.

"Hey, Kai, wouldn't it be fine for me to go first?" - asked Rinne with uneasiness in her voice - "I'm strong, so even if I surrounded..."

"If only Rinne would remember how to use radio...
Not being able to contact us after going in, would make it meaningless."

Putting his hands on her shoulders, Kai responded with a joke.

"...I'm leaving you a dangerous role. I'll be praying for your safety."

"Once I'll confirm it is safe, I'll call you."

Responding with these words to Jeanne, Kai stepped into light of magic circle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a href="#Part2" id="Part2" class="Bookmark"></a>

Sky...
Before his eyes, ears and all other senses, it was his skin that felt it.
He felt wind, that was fluttering his hair, with his whole body.
Kai looked around.

He was far in the skies.
Looking down he could see elven village among sea of ancient trees.
He was so high, that he could overlook the horizon.
That was where Kai stood.

"...This is angel's floating fortress?"

He was astonished by current altitude.
And the feeling that it gave.
Standing here he could overlook the whole ground down below.
Which made him feel almost like he climbed the top point of the world.

"Look, there is problem."

Elven girl, who was hiding her face behind hood, sighed as she put her hand on waist.

"There are no angels waiting to ambush, and no danger of thee to be entrapped."

"...This place is?"

"We are just behind the palace.
Right about when shadow should cover the place, so it is good spot to remain hidden."

There was dome like gigantic structure.
As Reiren told Kai has been transferred behind the palace itself.
Looking carefully around he didn't see any sign of angles.
But...

"Smoke?"

"No... Wait, what is this smell."

Kai and elf voices overlapped.
As strong wind, which was raging at top, changed its direction towards back of the palace, both of them felt bitter smell.
It was smell of something burning.
And even though it was hampered by the strong wind, they could hear some noise in direction of the palace.

"Kai, hold on calling thy friends here, something is wrong."

Elven girl put out her hands in front of her as if to check.
She went towards the palace's front alongside the white wall, which was made out of unknown metal.

"...This is... Just what happened here!?"

Shrine maiden was looking courtyard in front of the palace entrance.
[Angel Garden] was there occupying more than half of the space.
It was a beautiful vibrant and lushful paradise, full of greenery and flowers, but now it was painted by deep bright red colour.
Angel Garden was set ablaze.

This was a floating fortress that wasn't supposed to be invaded.
Yet now, it became gruesome place akin a purgatory, with blazing fire raging.
It was abnormal.
But regardless it was obviously not a trap of elves and angels.
Because Kai could see multiple bodies of angels lying down across the wide courtyard.

[Kai, what's going on!? Report...!]

He heard Jeanne's voice from the radio.
They might feel something is wrong since Kai and Reiren already climbed to Angel Palace, but yet to contact them.

[Kai, hey Kai!? What's happened!]

Rinne cut in.

"...It is all right. Both me and Reiren are safe, and there is no traps also."

There were blazing flame and fallen angels.
And glancing at bewildered by this scenery elven girl, Kai mustered his voice:

"Anyway you should get up here.
We definitely have abnormal situation here."

I have no idea what's going on - Kai reported with husky voice and tightly grasped the radio device.

<br>
<br>

"They are still breathing, so whoever did it had no plans to kill them.
But there are signs of torture.
They were attacked in a way as if to torment them."

Angles who fell face down, all were wearing so called heavenly garments, which was special kind of spirit garments, common among angels.
And the attacks that they received were strong enough to knock them out even through the spirit garment.

"As their comrade, it pains me to leave them as it is, but this is our chance."

Reiren sighed after looking at them for a while.

"It it perfect time to sneak into the palace.
Moreover, looking at how violently was destroyed the courtyard, I cannot imagine it is safe inside...
We must not delay, follow me!"

She quickly put back her hood and run.
And she was fast.
Despite her small build, but her leg, which were kicking the grass, strength wasn't inferior to human soldier.

"How many hundred years thee think I've been running through our forest?
It might not look like that, but I've been training."

_TL  Note:_ `こう見えて鍛えておるわ` I think author shortened last sentence quite a bit? But correct me if I'm wrong.

Elf said with a smug.
Even though she was speaking, her speed never dropped down as they were crossing angel palace main gate.
Then foreign gods girl jumped into opened window in palace wall.
The window had no glass to it.
Most likely it was just a [hole] to let in wind and sunlight.

"Inside palace may be passages, but there was no floors, right?"

"That's right.
For angels who have wings, floor would something akin to bird perch.
There are only few such places in entire palace."

Elf asserted in response to Jeanne, who was running in parallel with her.
Only angels, who have wings, were coming into the palace.
So to say it was one big pitfall via which anyone without wings would fall down to the forest.
It is likely also measures against demons, cryptids and spirits.

_TL Notes:_ Seems a strange countermeasure to be honest, but that's is written by author...

"But then we'd be troubled. Dwarves, fairies and elves do not possess wings."

Among foreign gods were their comrades who walked ground.
For their sake Heaven Lord Alfreya prepared special pathway.
And right now through exactly such pathway Reiren was running.

"Jeanne-sama, it is a fortunate for us." - Fairin whispered - "Without elven guidance it would be extremely difficult for us to storm this floating fortress."

"Looking back it might be thanks to Dante."

_TL Note:_ `元を返せば` is used here which kinda similar to `裏を返せば`

"Quite hasty, do not forget that human life is in my grasp."

Said elven girl who was running through empty corridor.
Walls, floor and ceiling.
Everything was made of transparently white metal.
Being polished like that it looked just like marble, but as he could feel elasticity through his boots.
It was marvellous metal that was both sold and soft.

"Rinne, is that light in ceiling due to magic?"

"Yup, but I do not find it unpleasant so I don't think it is a trap.
Since there is no need to use magic to light the place during daytime, it might belong to <span title="jp. 感知系 Since it is basically magical sensors? Might need to revise it later">divination system</span>."

Said Rinne who looked up at the magical pattern on surface of ceiling.
It blinked at the same time as they passed under it.

"It is barrier.
Which would seems to shine as soon as someone other than angels would enter.
It shined all the same when we with elders passed through."

"Then we are trespassing here?"

"Guards would notice, but they are not going to come here.
Remember the time at courtyard."

_TL Note:_ I don't get this one `ほれ、あの中庭で倒れておったうちの二体じゃ`, need to complete it

For a short while it became quiet.
Heavy footsteps were echoing through the corridor.
Each and every of them fell into silence and were looking for words -
Such silence wrapped the angel palace.

_There were more than dozen defeated angels in courtyard._

_Just who was this guy who came before us and defeated all of them._

Someone from other races?
But if that would be the case, then as soon as someone would cross Io national border, he would be discovered by angels floating fortress nearby borders.
And elves would notice any suspicious person in the ancient forest.
So this time it wasn't the case.

"I can think of two possible scenarios."

The one who broke the silence was female warrior, who was running behind Jeanne.

"First is that captured elven elders broke out on their own."

"That's not the case.
Thee should understand that if they'd done it, then it would result in war with angels."

"Then the second possibility..."

"Let us hear it."

"It is possible Heaven Lord Alfreya himself punished these angels in courtyard."

"Yes!?"

"W-what do you mean, Fairin-sama!?"

Elven shrine maiden remained silent.
And the one who shouted in surprise were Saki and Ashlan, who were in the end of their formation.

"It is just process of elimination.
This fortress is highly difficult to invade from outside.
Only their comrades foreign gods can enter: elves, dwarves, fairies.
And if they are not perpetrators, then the only possible answer is angels themself."

"..."

They followed the path which suddenly took turn to the right.
There was a door, which is likely locked by magic.
Elf remained silent as she crossed past gigantic 4 meters tall door and continued running.

_TL Note:_ I'm a bit unsure what author means by `大きく右に曲がる通路` to be honest

"Alfreya required submission out of others among foreign gods, right?"

"...That's right."

"But that was only Alfreya demand alone.
Difficult to image that all other angels agreed with his idea.
There should be some who objected for sure."

Alfreya punished his disobedient subordinates.
That was her speculation about felled angels in courtyard.

"Argument?"

"Yes, and if we're talking about possible scenarios, we cannot deny that it is the most likely scenario."

To that elven girl replied:

"I'm no longer capable of comprehending Alfreya-dono.
Otherwise I wouldn't disguise myself as human in order to save our comrades."

Elf slightly shook her head.

"...We're already here.
Going through a teleportation gate beyond there we should be able to reach underground level."

The corridor was ending here.
Elven shrine maiden put her hand on tightly shut door and light patterns enveloped her body.

"Reiren!?"

"There is no need for a worry.
This door requires magic power in order to be operated.
See, it is opened."

This bulky metallic door, which looked like hundred kilograms heavy, was wide open.
His first thought was that it is a place of prayer..
In the big round hall was standing altar of brass colour.
Both walls and ceiling had many windows, and bright light shined throughout the wide room.
This light...

"Battle axe - Hundred wind sonatas." _TL Note:_ Ok, I have no idea what to make out of it `戦斧・五百箇の風破`.

It blown off in front of light that shined through the ceiling.
It's white surface collapsed.
And from there massive winds down poured onto altar, smashing it into pieces.
Remaining strength of wind scattered against all surrounding walls.
It affected not only Kai and other humans, but even Reiren who was supposed to belong to foreign gods.

"Argh...!"

Elven girl received incoming pebbles with her whole body.
As her hood was lifted, both her face and beautiful hair were exposed.

"Oh dear? My my, My my." _TL Note:_ It is ara-ara type of girl.

From broken ceiling, winged foreign god has descended.
It was angel with four wings.
Beautiful female angel with cold grey eyes and wavy hair of flax colour.
In her hand was battle axe, clearly not suitable for such delicate arms.

"I was wondering just who brought filthy smell to our sacred palace.
After it was you.
Elven shrine maiden Reiren Leil Racheliel" _TL Note_: Full name `レーレーン・レイル・レーチェリエル`, don't think it is going to be used often.

"...Battle Angle Vicious" _TL Note:_ Name tells everything you need to know about this angel, sensei is really kind here, comparing to Reiren full name.

Elven girls wiped blood from her mouth by a back of her hand.

"Thee... What did you say just now...?"

"Are your ears just for decoration?
Even though they are so big.
After all surface creatures are the same.
Just animals that crawl on the ground."

"...Even thee."

On elf's face wasn't displayed anger, but rather sadness and astonishment.
She was standing there in shock, not believing into betrayal of old friend.

"Were thee depraved by thirst for power!?"

"Depraved? What are you saying."

Said female angle with battle axe in single hand. _TL Note:_ This one is actually weird for me `戦斧を片手に浮遊する女天使`

"I'm but a servant of Heaven Lord Alfreya-sama.
Everything I'm doing is for the sake of that person."

"..."

"Ah, right, let me tell you something very good.
Shrine maiden Reiren, you appeared at quite good time."

Angel with very beautiful face made a distorted smile.

"We shall start execution of elven elders immediately.
And it will be done by Alfreya-sama himself."

"...!?"

(Reiren) screamed without voice.
With her fair skin, her expression looked deadly pale as if she loosed all blood.

"Wh...what is meaning of this!?"

"This will be a lesson.
Even elves would learn own place once your elders will be dead.
And of course the same goes to dwarves and fairies."

"This would troubling."

Instead of elven shrine maiden Reiren, it was silver haired knight who stepped forward.

"I'm Commander Jeanne.
Not planning to explain the whole situation here, but elders are under our protection."

"A human? Shrine maiden Reiren, to bring humans into this palace, you're already sinner beyond salvation.
After all there was no mistake to Alfreya-sama's judgement."

Angel, with battle axe in her hands, flapped her wings.

"Angles stand atop of foreign gods.
Every other race are nothing more but a slave.
If you're going to defy us...
Then I shall eliminate you with my own hands!"

She raised above her head battle axe of mercury colour.
It was <span title="jp. 法具 It is not Noble Phantasm of FGO 宝具 But I cannot think of good name, so let me know if you have ideas.">magic tool</span> - once it receives angels magical power, this weapon could materialize paranormal phenomena in the world just like magic.

"O, axe clad in storms, tear apart these people."

She didn't meant to use axe's blade to strike.
Angel, who was clad in winds that were just like small storm, dived in from the broken roof.
And she swung down her axe towards Jeanne and elven girl who stood just behind her.

"Fairin."

"...Surge" _TL Note:_ Not sure how to translate  it `迸れ`

Bright red pillar of fire appeared.
From below came slashing attack which deflected her battle axe.
Moreover from the floor itself fire arose and followed towards angel, clad in winds.

"My attack!?"

Vicious was now enveloped by fire.

"Tch, what a impudent human, to go against me...!"

"I've been told it many times. By both demons and cryptids. But it is first time from angel."

Female warrior, who responded to her with sarcasm, carried crimson shamshir.
From the sword's point were coming out fire, almost like a lava.
And the blade itself wasn't work of humans, but [Drake's Tooth].
It was fang left by drake in land where cryptids were rampaging.
It's impact was creating violent burst of fire.
And that fire surged forward toward Vicious.

"Fire."

Gun shots could be heard.
Behind Saki and Ashlan readied their guns and started firing.
And despite having strong divine protection, Vicious stepped back to avoid being shot.

"Jeanne-sama, please go ahead."

![Fairin](./p227.jpg)

She pointed with pair of her shamshirs towards back of the altar.
There was door leading to another room.

"This angel's magic tool has wind attribute.
And my dragon tooth has the best affinity with it.
With two of our subordinates we should be able to deal with her."

"For humans thee are quite good."

Elven shrine maiden Reiren placed her hands on the door.
As with the entrance here as soon as the door received her magic power, it started to open.

"I will not let you!"

"Hey, we'll be your opponents!"

Ashlan, who was firing barrage from his machine gun, was keeping angel pinned down.
Angel's body wasn't much different from that of humans and elves.
She couldn't avoid injuries if she'd be shot, so Vicious had no choice but to focus keeping her divine protection.

"Go, Kai! We have Fairin-sama so we'll manage somehow!"

"Thanks. Jeanne, Rinne!"

Together with both of them behind him, Kai followed after elven girl with all of his strength.
They could hear echoes of gunshots and blazing fire.
And as raging winds sound disappeared - chapel's doors were closed.

"Angel's leader, just how low did you fell!"

Elven girl took off her travelling clothes.
There was no longer any meaning in pretending to be human.
If her hesitation here, would mean getting elven leaders to be executed.

They were in one long and big pathway.
Both on left and right they could see nine columns.
Total 18 columns were lined up along their way in this passage.

Reiren was taking a lead.
Following by Kai, Rinne and Jeanne.
The lighted passage had not even a bit of dust floating around.
Atmosphere was completely stagnant and no sound of insects or animals could be heard.

_It is too quiet._

_This silence is just omnious._

They run while carefully observing columns of 2 meters diameter.
It wouldn't be strange for angels to hide themself behind these gigantic pillars.

"Reiren, are there any other angels we should be aware?"

"If thee are asking about angels who are loyal to Alfreya, then the answer is [all].
Among angels in angel palace everyone hold respect for Alfreya."

On other hand, foreign god already inflicted punishment upon such subordinates.
And cruelly thrown them out into courtyard.

"If among these who we still haven't saw, then that would be archangel Raphael."

"..."

Rinne suddenly stop.
As if searching for something she looked at ceiling and then started looking among 18 pillars.

"Hey, Kai, I'd like to rest here."

"Eh?"

"W-what are thee saying, little girl!?
Just a bit more... There we shall reach that Alfreya.
Look, there is light formation, once we'll cross it, we'll be there."

_TL Note:_ I'm a bit unsure what author means here `光の方陣`

Shrine maiden turned towards her with mix of anger in her expression.
Even Jeanne behind her was taken aback.

"What are you going to do if other angels would appear!
Even though it is just a little more and we're there."

"Nah, I'm resting."

"This girl....!?"

"Shut up, stop talking.
Hey, Kai, I'm going to take a rest but it is ok for you to continue going."

He had a sense of deja vu.

[...It is all right. I'll be ok so.]

[Go, Kai. If you'll remain with me, they'll continue chasing you.
Go up and wait for me.]

It was during their operation in Urza's capital.
On the girl said, he left her behind surrounded by demons and climbed to the top floor of government palace.
Only Kai and Rinne knew about it.

"Rinne, are you really..."

"It is nothing really."

She replied with extremely bright smile on her face.

"Go ahead. After I'll rest I'll catch up with you."

"...Understood."

He added more strength to his hand on which shoulder was his Drake Nail.
And placing his hand on shoulder of elven girl, who was still fussing, Kai pointed to the end of passage.
There was formation of ascending lights, just like water fountain.
Many many light circles were appearing out of it and ascending up.

"We just have to go there, right?"

"Yes, no doubt about it.
I entered through it once."

"Got it, Jeanne are you ok too?"

"Of course."

Tightly grasped her silver sword, commander of Urza Resistance stepped forward.

"Let us challenge the foreign gods hero."

"...Who would think it would come to this."

Elven girl started climbing the stairs
As she reached 13 step and touched the formation, her delicate body started slowly floating.

"Hey now, thee should follow already."

"Kai, one thing."

While he was in the middle of climbing the stairs.

"I'm really sorry for leaving you the most dangerous fight with Vanessa.
I wanted to say it always..."

"Jeanne?"

"This time I'm going to fight together with you."

Knight, who dressed like a man, exhaled.
Tightening her lips, she stepped onto last step of the stairs together with Kai.
And then towards light formation...

![Jeanne](./p233.jpg)
