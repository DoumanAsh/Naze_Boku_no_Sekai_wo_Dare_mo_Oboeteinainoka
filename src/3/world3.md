At the naturally created border...
It is been three days and nights since they passed through the forest, controlled by foreign gods.
Finally vast plain of ocher colour appeared, where was the national border that separated Io and Yurun.

"I'm able to guide thee only up to here."

Said the elven shrine maiden, who looked reluctant seeing off the fading away forest.

"Beyond these plains lies the Yurun country. Thee know this much, right?"

"That's right. Once again quite a depressing scenery..."

Ashlan answered from the driver's seat.
As Kai's arm was wounded in the battle with the Behemoth, right now he assumed the driving role.

"I thought I got tired of this maze of big trees, now it is just plains with weed all the way."

"Right so. Having nothing around instead makes it suspicious, right..."

Sitting on the passenger seat, Saki was anxiously looking with her binoculars through a window.

"Talking about the border.
Aren't four races supposed to watch over it normally?"

"It is but a exaggeration.
Only demons watch over the entire border.
As only they possess sufficient numbers."

Reiren said from the back seat on the right.

"By the way, Kai, how is thy wound on the left arm?"

"Hey, you!"

From the left came Rinne in order to 'restrain' her.

"I'm the one who is going to worry about Kai's arm.
Kai, is it ok?"

"Muu. There is anyway nothing to do, might as well not to mind a small talk."

Reiren was having a seat on the right side.
While Rinne was on the left.

Being caught from both sides, Kai leaned on the back of his seat.

_TL Note:_ `座席のシート` Ehm... Honestly sometimes I think I don't know japanese

"It is all right, but it would nice if you wouldn't cling to my arm so much..."

As his arm was fixed with a bandage, he was unable to move it.

But then Rinne was clinging to Kai with such arm, not leaving his side.
Of course he appreciated her [I'm going to protect you] sentiment, but each time Rinne would put in some strength,
Kai would feel impact through the whole arm up to the shoulder, making his wound to ache and becoming source of his worry.

"Hey, Saki. How long should we go?"

"Mmm, some more time I guess?
But well even I've gotten tired of riding the car."

They've been on the road three days and three nights.
By now Kai's party traversed several hundred kilometers.
Consisting of 30 military cars, closely following each other, their party was starting to run out of both provisions and battery powers.

_TL note:_ Interestingly author always mentions batteries, but never oil, like cars don't need it there.

"Seems it is going to take a bit more to reach the human city...
But this map is like ten years old, so I'm not sure how reliable it is."

Saki was continuously starting at the map of the continent.
_TL Note:_ Re-phrased `サキが睨めっこを続ける相手は大陸地図。` as I'm not sure if you can say something like that in english

"Hey, isn't that the thing?"

Rinne, who was looking out of the window, pointed straight ahead at the horizon.

"There is town of humans."

"Hm? Where it is, Rinne? I cannot see anything there.
Wait, wait, where are binoculars...
Ah, it is really there!
Looks like some sort of abandoned building...
Wait, ehh... What's that!?"

Saki raised her voice in surprise as she was looking through binoculars.

"...A little perilous."

Reiren who got up from the back seat, knitted her eyebrows.

"Kai, can thee contact Jeanne behind?
These ruins, these are not just simple buildings.
Might be better to make a detour.
It is a nest of the spirits."

"Really!? Jeanne, this is the vanguard car, answer me!"

He tightly grasped the radio.
Without waiting for a reply, Kai continued his report to commander's car, which was following them.

Rinne and Reiren, whose eyesight surpassed that of Kai, were already able see a scenery beyond the horizon.

"Ahead on our path are ruins, which became a nest of spirits.
I suggest taking a detour!"

[I was about to contact you about it.]

He couldn't sense any worry in Jeanne's voice.

[We're receiving directions on the course to our destination from a radio corps of Yurun Resistance.
And we're told to head straight ahead as it is.]

"Then..."

[There is indeed the nest of spirits among that group of building.
However there are no signs of spirits themselves.
It would seem that about two years ago they moved to a another place.]

_TL TODO:_ Second sentence refer to spirits as `肝心の聖霊族` and it is unclear how to interpret `肝心の`

"...Meaning it is completely empty, huh?"

It was similar to the migration of birds.

Spirits had a tendency to frequently migrate from their nests each dozen of years.
But the reason was unclear.

"But there is a chance that some remain on lookout, is it not?"

[There will be few at most.
We've been requested to intercept them in case we'll have an encounter.
Put it simply: While Yurun Resistance welcomes us, they also intend to test us at the same time.]

Just few spirits.
If they would go all out against them, it wouldn't be a serious threat.

[For us it would be welcoming experience.
Before full blown confrontation with spirits, I believe it would be valuable for us to gain experience fighting them right now]

"Therefore heading straight to it, huh..."

Just beyond the horizon shadow of the city could be spotted with naked eye.

On these vast plains, illuminated by intense rays of sun, queer scenery appeared in front of Kai's own eyes.

...Shining ruins.

Steel buildings were covered by something moss-like, casting lights.

Was it spider threads or maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha">hyphae</a>?

It looked like a shining object d'art.
Once a human city, it had been transformed into bizarre [nest].

_Demons just use human's cities as it is when they snatch it._

_Foreign gods are not living in human cities at all and instead letting it to get consumed by the forest._

But spirits were different.

They just transform city's buildings into completely different thing.
One had to wonder just what kind of life form could make such nest.

"Whew... That's gross.
Buildings are completely covered in something like bluish mold."

"Ashlan, turn a bit to the right now.
We don't really need to go through the center of these ruins.
Whenever possible we should go by the edge of the city."

As they were going through ruins that became a nest to the spirits.
In order to pass this eerie building even a second faster, they started to raise the speed.

"Rinne, just to be sure, did you have to fight spirits before?"

"Mmm, just a bit?
But I really disliked it cuz I had no idea what spirits are thinking."

"...Undoubtedly they are not someone you can talk with."

<span title="Yes, you didn't read wrong. It is スライム">Slimes</span>. Ghosts. Lanterns.
Among five races, including humans, they were the only race that didn't use human language.
The reason for that was quite simple: they didn't posses intelligence to comprehend language.

Therefore any discussion was out of question.

"But spirits are well versed when it comes to creeping around.
They can hide from sight and completely eliminate any sound...
Who might know if our car is not already in their sights."

"Please stop, Reiren!?"

Saki screamed while tightly gripping her hand grenade as if it was a precious talisman.

Guns were ineffective against the spirits.

While bullets could wound slimes, they would quickly restore themself up.
As for ghosts and lanterns bullets would just pass through them.

They had to be completely destroyed by flame or blast.

[Preparing counter-measures against traits of each race is very bothersome.]

[There is a universal way to overcome such resistances regardless of race.
That is a _blast_.]

_TL Note:_ These are Vanessa's lines from V1C5

Seeing Saki holding hand grenade so dearly made Kai to remember the Vanessa.

At that time...
Never ever he would imagine himself doing something like coming to spirits' land.

"Okay, we're already leaving the city."

"...Ah, nice. I was thinking my life is going to shorten."

Kai's car passed buildings.
Following them was the second car, then the third and so on, passing through the spirit' nest,
but there were no signs of anything threating to attack them.

"Jeanne, how are things on your end?"

[We're passing through without troubles.
Though unfortunately it also means that we're not going to meet the Yurun's Resistance's expectations.]

From the other side of radio he heard Commander's self-deprecating laugh.

[To all cars, follow road straight ahead.
We're heading towards the Yurun's Resistance headquarters.
Their leader is a renowned commander Balmnung-dono, also commonly known as _Lion King_.
Be mindful to not act impolite.]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a href="#Part2" id="Part2" class="Bookmark"></a>

A stronghold among wilderness Ruin S Fulham.
The <span title="jp. 赤煉瓦">red brick</span> castle.
Once it was a land where a <span title="jp. 一族 literally single family, but to be accurate it is probably branch of rouyal family, hence I used clan to say it short">clan</span>,
who lost a fight for a crown of Yurun, had escaped.

And this stronghold, which was the last hope of mankind crushed by Spirits' invasion...
Was a headquarters of the Yurun's Resistance.

"Welcome to our Resistance.
Let us greet expedition of our fellow army!"

_TL Note:_ Original greeting: `ようこそ我らの人類反旗軍へ。貴軍らの遠征を歓迎するものである！`
First phrase is clear: he welcomes them at the HQ.
But the second is a bit more tricky as it kinda repeats a similar thing, but with a stronger emotional emphasis (due to `ものである`) and with their guest to be a subject
So I feel it is more like a command to his subordinates to greet guests?

With hundreds soldiers be his side...

The giant man with his golden hair and bear, befitting of a lion, loudly exclaimed.

His upper torso looked even greater than that of his subordinates.
But despite his fierce look that would make left any child crying, his voice didn't sound harsh.

He was the Lion King Balmnung.

_Exact opposite of the emperor Dante._

_Despite his large frame and fierce look, meeting him face to face doesn't feel so suffocating._

_TL Note:_ Let's be honest, Dante can only cause you to feel disgusted, I doubt his presence would pressure anyone.

In front of Kai Light Knight Jeanne came forward and shared a firm handshake with Lion King Balmnung.

"Thank you for coming all this way.
Jeanne-dono, rumours of your great achievements reached even this remote land.
I want to borrow your strength."

"It is nice to meet you, Balmnung-dono.
I thank you for your welcome."

Comparing to the Lion King Balmnung's stature, Commander Jeanne, who was disguising as a man, looked like a child.
Despite their physique being like that of a child and adult, Lion King didn't show any hint of mocking that.

"Balmnung-dono, are we going to gather for the meeting as it is?"

"While this is what I'd like to say, but your honorable army requires a rest after such long trip.
Not to mention your cars would need some checking to do.
Allow my engineering squad to assist with that."

He pointed to the stronghold's entrance.

"Jeanne-dono, we could go together to the office.
Well, nothing like a strategy meeting, just a small talk."

"Meaning?"

"The good news of you crushing the demons' hero and foreign gods submitting to you.
I would be glad to hear about it in details.
As I wish to spread these news among seven cities in the Yurun too."

"I understand, then by all means."

Lion King Balmnung walked with a long stride, and Jeanne joined him by the side.

"...This is quited different from our time in the Io.
Looks like a decent commander."

"Really.
I thought Dante was like a sly king, but here I can see a leader of soldiers.
Well, he looks scary though."

Saki and Ashlan were whispering to each other.

On other hand behind them was elven shrine maiden Reiren who was grumbling with a sullen look on her face:
[Foreign gods submitting?
Huh, what a joke.
It is just a cease fire.]

"Hey, Kai?"

Rinne pulled his right hand's sleeve. _TL TODO:_ I'm pretty sure you don't say it like that in english, so need to fix this literal translation.

"What are we going to do now?
Jeannya already left though?."

"Yeah, let's see... ehm."

"For you it should be all for today.
I'll attend to Jeanne-sama, so you can go ahead to rest up."

As Farin was going after Jeanne, she whispered to him when passing by him.

"This place has a trustworthy commander. He is different from the Dante."

"Could it be you know him?"

"For about a year.
I just served here during my soldier's training."

She said with a profound smile.

Leaving it at that, the female guard disappeared inside the castle.

<br>
<br>

Human city Ruin S Quin.

It was located 30 meters under the stronghold Rin S Fulham...
The largest known underground city of Yurun, which could be reached by taking a elevator inside a solid bedrock.

Similarly to Urza's Neo Vishal it utilized underground railway system, but there was one main difference and that was a scale.

Neo Vishal was at most of the size as single shopping district.

While Ruin S Quin was said to almost completely replicate the townscape of Yurun's capital.

Thanks to vast plains they benefited from wind and solar energies.
Due to that they were able to maintain all production factories.

The cornerstone of it all was...
Throughout defense of Ruin S Fulham stronghold.

"You're not Balmnung-dono's people, aren't you?"

Human city, Ruin S Quin, northern district...

Inside the hospital, which also filled with piles of books and served as library, old head doctor was skillfully undoing Kai's bandages.

_TL Note:_ It doesn't said _inside_ in original text, but it sounds better this way

"I'm not versed in nature of spirits.
They look for humans' ruins and make their nest out of it.
You'd think they'll make it their base, but a few years later they abandon the nest and start the migration."

"...They abandon their own territory?"

"There are cases when destination of the said migration is humans' shelters too.
As they abandon old territory they start searching for the new one.
Almost as if they are locust swarm."

He finished undoing bandages covered in blood and dust.

"...Oh?"

The old doctor opened his eyes wide beyond lens of his glasses.
He fixated his gaze unto wound left by Behemoth's fang gouging Kai's left shoulder.

"It even took some meat from your shoulder.
You're young, but did well to endure it.
Disinfecting also was quite painful, wasn't it?"

"Luckily, I had painkillers on me."

"Fool. It is not a minor wound.
Fortunately the wound itself didn't fester, but..."

Next old man's gaze shifted to Kai's face.

"Your face doesn't look like of someone reckless.
In contrast with your appearance."

"...I've been told that I'm stubborn."

"For forty years that I've been examining soldiers that come here I cannot remember seeing such gruesome wound.
I cannot imagine fight with spirits would cause such wound though."

"I've been bitten by a bit large beast..."

"Bitten, you say?
Meaning this wound on your shoulder is left by teeth?"

A hand of the old doctor, who was re-applying bandages, stopped.

"And what was the beast that could leave such large teeth marks?
Could it be you've been attacked by a dragon?"

"Something like that."

"..."

The old doctor was speechless.

If it would be a soldier or a civilian then they would just laugh it off as a [absurd joke],
but this old doctor could guess the size of monster from marks of the fang that left the wound on Kai's shoulder.

"It will be one of these two.
Either you die young or become great warrior like Balmnung-dono...
Now then, examination is over.
I'll prescribe you strong painkillers."

"Will it be ok to hold a gun?"

"Wouldn't recommend.
You'll be unable to use left arm for a time being.
While painkillers will do their job, your grip will remain weak either way."

He was weakened.
While his face didn't show it, this is what he felt about the situation.

Jeanne and Urza Resistance were going to participate in the fight against spirits.

In situation where he couldn't use one of his hands, if he would for example end up fighting the spirits' hero then...

"What is it?"

"I was just thinking.
Going need to use every possible trick to survive."

No soldier that protects the city has to pay money here...

Kai bowed to the old doctor who firmly refused to take any payment, leaving the infirmary behind.

<br>
<br>

Public cottage.
Normally soldiers were staying at the one of the seven Yurun's cities,
And occasionally they would gather at stronghold Ruin S Fulham for a start of large council of war.

This was one of these lodgings which they would use during that time.

"This is cool.
Since these lodgings are used by soldiers they got conference room here,
and they mentioned something about lending us tools to look after our guns, right?"

"Moreover it is completely lent to us.
They are so welcoming that it is actually scaring me."

Saki and Ashlan were taking the baggage out of the car.

As he saw the two walking down the corridor with plenty of baggage...

"Hm?"

He heard a energetic voice from within of a room that was allocated to them.

"It is completed!" _TL Note:_ Reiren

"Hey, hey, are you sure it is going to be ok?
It smells a great deal..."

"Thee can leave it to me.
If thee would like, how about sampling it?"

"Mmm, rather not to."

These voices belonged to Rinne and Reiren.

He asked both of them to take care of their luggage while he was going to the old doctor,
but surprisingly he could hear lively voices from the other side of the door.

"Hey, Rinne? Reiren?
...Eeww, what's this smell!?"

His nose was assaulted by awful smell.

As soon as he opened the door he was attacked by a bizarre mix of sweetness, like that coming from condensed milk, together
with a rotten smell that would make you cough when you inhale it.

"I'll open the window to ventilate..."

"What is thee saying? I'm just making a elixir. Look."

Elven shrine maiden pridefully shown off a flask.

Just as Kai brought his nose closer to slowly boiling pink liquid, he was assaulted by even stronger smell that filled the room.

"What a terrible smell, but is that an elven elixir...?"

It was said that elves and dwarves who were living in the forest would combine together various fruits and leaves that were natural remedies and create elixirs, holding mysterious powers.

_Potion that could cure ten thousand illnesses with a single drop._

_<span title="alchocol">Sake</span> that could tame any animal in the forest._

Then there was a thing that Reiren hold in her hand.
To Kai it felt like a smell of a juice, squeezed out of food scraps.

"Thy wound, human medicine is unlikely to have much of effect, isn't it?"

Reiren looked at his bandages.

"That said thee would be troubled fighting spirits in such sorry state.
Therefore <span title="Rephrased 特別に as I think she is trying to say it to make him feel honoured by her kindness">feeling generous</span>,
I thought of trying to make elixir that would cure your wound in a half of day."

"Half of day!?"

"Umu. If thee drinks it this evening, tomorrow it shall be healed completely without leaving any single trace of the wound."

"Hearing you now makes me less inclined to try it though..."

"Well, I wouldn't mind two thousand massages as a reward too."

"Are you old man!?
...Ah, well, I suppose you're older than human elderly."

_TL Note:_ No one would mind giving her such reward... aside from our hero ofc.
Ei, Kai, what are you doing!? Reiren is such good girl and you cannot even reward her properly!?

As he received the flask from Reiren, he was fixated his gaze inside.

That pink liquid.
Even though it wasn't burning hot, it continued to boil on it's own.
And then there was this smell that would wake you up.

It was so suspicious looking that he wasn't even sure where to start with.

"What about this pink colour?"

"Umu. See, the finishing touch is a fruit of the <span title="jp. 冬仙花">winter mountain flower</span>.
Boiling it and then drinking would greatly boost body's metabolism...
Or so I'd like to say, but this herb grows only deep inside the elven forest,
therefore I had to substitute it with a different thing."

"Eh. But this is a human's town.
Would there be a replacement?"

For Reiren, who was part of foreign gods, this place was a enemy's den.

It was hard to imagine that this elven shrine maiden, who wouldn't go out unless she is with Kai, walking around the city.

"I've requested Rinne."

"Rinne?
Did you find some alternative remedy on the market?"

Saying that, Kai noticed in Rinne's hand a small plastic bag for a shopping.

"So see, this flat elf said that winter mounter flower's fruit is small and red,
that's why I was looking for a similar fruit."

"What did you buy?"

"Strawberry."

"Not good!?" _TL Note:_ I'm honestly not sure if Reiren is asking or stating a fact.

Without even testing it was obviously a failure as the replacement.

"This sweet smell, is that a strawberry...?"

"Hey, Kai.
Do not sniff it like a timid dog,
summon thy courage and just drink it to see for thyself.
There would be no other chance for a human to try out the elven elixir."

"This boiling thing?
Obviously it is going to burn my throat, but how do elves drink it?
Do you not cool it?"

"I do not know."

"Eh?"

The moment elven shrine maiden gave him answer with such serious look, Kai turned white.

"This is a first time for me to see it in such boiling state.
I wonder if there was some sort of mistake when I've been mixing it."

"Obviously there is some mistake, isn't!?"

"Well, worry not, just gulp it in one go."

She pushed flask with suspicious liquid towards him.

"...Well then Reiren try a single gulp and see how it goes.
If everything is all right then I'll drink it too."

"Very well. See then."

Taking the flask into her hand the elf sipped directly from it.
With a deep gulp, she finished.

"See?
Smell might be a bother, but once savor it, thee shall feel invigorating."

"Oh? Really."

"..."

![Reiren with flask](./p133.jpg)

"Reiren?"

"...Blarghhh...!"

"Vomiting blood!?
Isn't it a complete failure?
Oi, Reiren, come on!"

The elf fell down with a cry of agony

_Good that I didn't drink it._

Kai felt relieved all the while patting her back.

<br>
<br>

"Night" of the underground city.

Going to the surface would let you to see a scenery of vast plains dyed in colour of <span title="jp. 薄墨 It is kinda bleak black colour I guess?">diluted ink</span>.
With night wind washing away and tearing apart clouds, would let stars to peek through these gaps.

But...

Nothing of that was here.

Being 30 meters under the stronghold Ruin S Fulham, all they would see is lights of tunnel's ceiling to disappear.

Illumination is lit on mornings, and disappears on nights.

_I already had the same experience in Neo Vishal._

_Seems the situation is the same even outside of Urza._

He was unused to idea of such 'night'.

To Kai's surprise the elven shrine maiden Reiren, who was probably the most used to natural night, was soundly asleep with a little discomfort.

It was likely that she accumulated quite a lot of mental fatigue after leaving the elven forest for the first time in her life.

Kai's room had three beds.

With her body in side posture she was soundly sleeping on the inner most bed.
She took off her seventh layered robes, and now she was in thin nightdress.
Although the design was tight, completely fitting her body, the dress was tailored up to her ankles.

"...I think it would be good if you'd go to sleep too, Rinne."

"Are you sleepy?"

On the middle one of three beds.

On the bed that had enough space to stretch yourself for a single adult, Rinne was lying down with her face down closely to Kai, while he faced up.

Kai's left shoulder...

Was barely at a distance close enough to not touch his wound, covered in bandages.

"We should sleep on own..." _TL Note:_ Original text is `自分のベッドは……` where verb is omitted. Literally `own beds...` which makes a little sense in english so I changed it.

"No way."

The girl gently touched his left elbow with both hands.

"Kai was hurt like this because of me.
That's why I'm going to protect Kai.
Until wounds are healed, I'm not going to leave Kai's side absolutely."

"Rinne..."

"Though even if wounds are healed, I'm not leaving too."

"That's a business as usual!?"

She was persistent about being by his side.

Now that she was used to daily life, even if it was the same room, they were supposed to sleep on separate beds.
But this night it would seem she rejected the idea of sleeping on a separate bed.

"Reiren was able successfully mix the medicine with a second try.
It is going to be healed properly."

"...Was it bitter? Medicine of that flat elf."

"Good medicine is a bitter one."

First time her elixir was a failure, but second time she was able to do it successfully.

At first she tasted it herself as a creator of the mixture, next was Rinne, afterwards Kai drunk it.

_I don't feel like my wounds started to close up faster though._

_When used on the human the elven medicine should at least has rejuvenation effect._

It was so effective that it would put a heavy strain on the body.
And due to the elixir containing elven magic power, it might have a side effects when used on the human.

What kind of effect it would be was entirely up to Kai.

His life could be shortened, or it could also be prolonged.

"By the way, Rinne, weren't you saying it was too cramped to sleep in sleeping bag of our tent?"

"Yeah it was cramped."

"Then..."

"Kai, how do you think I'm thinking of Kai?" _TL Note:_ Yes, it is indeed weird `カイは、わたしがカイのこと何て思ってると思う？`

That was rather straightforward.

Kai was about to say, but his words stuck in a throat.
Not because of the meaning of these words.

Amidst the darkness.
Light in Rinne's gaze became clear to a scary degree.
He felt as if he was being sucked in by just gazing into these eyes of deep sea colour.

"..."

She risen from her laying posture with upper half of her body, standing on elbows.
She was only in single thin nightdress.

"...It is strange. Really mysterious feeling."

"Eh?"

"I'm very happy together with Kai. I like you.
Even if it is only my own feelings, it is more than enough.
I..."

The girl went silent.

She closed her small mouth and was just looking at him.

"What should I do to make Kai to start liking me..."

"..."

She wanted to be closer to him, to touch him and to get to know him even more.

Such was appeal coming from her eyes.

"I cannot?"

He wouldn't deny it.
And he didn't hate it.

In fact it was making him glad to receive Rinne's affection,
and he shown no desire to betray these feelings.

But...

"I understand... To be honest with you, I'm just not used to it.
Actually, I'm also not used to talk about it."

"What?"

"Well, having girl like Rinne sleeping so close.
In the true world I was living in man's dormitory and I've been always sharing double room with Ashlan.
Saki and Jeanne were staying at completely different place: woman's dormitory."

"..."

Rinne titled her head with curious look on her face.

"Does Kai like Ashlan?" _TL Note:_ LOL I'm ded

"...No, I didn't mean that, just there we had strict rules on gender segregation."

"Why?"

"This is going to be a rather philosophical discussion so let's have it at another time.
Anyway, the reason why I'm hesitant about sleeping with you, Rinne, is not because I dislike the idea.
I'm just not used to it.
Even you, Rinne, first time you came to human city, you wasn't used to it, right?"

"...Yup."

"Did you understand it?"

"Understood."

Seeing Rinne so quickly agreeing was almost anti-climatic.

This reply of her brought only a brief moment of relief to him.

"Then I'm going to give Kai training."

"...Yes?"

"Yay, caught you!"

With a vigour of carnivore that is aiming for its prey, Rinne hugged him around torso.

"I didn't know that Kai is bad at sleeping together with a girl.
But no worries, I'll give you a training.
We're going to sleep together more, far more than before!"

"I didn't mean it like that though!?
Actually, Rinne, shoulder is bad idea.
It is in pain, it is painful when you cling to it so...!"

"Eh? What, I didn't hear you."

She was so obsessed with clinging to him that no longer his voice could reach her.

While he was desperately trying to shake from such Rinne...

"Eei, silence!"

Hearing elf's voice, Kai and Rinne stopped moving completely.

"Be quiet during the night.
Even though I'm grateful that today's day ended without troubles, I wish to rest my body peacefully.
Cannot thee comprehend that much at least!?"

"...Ok."

"...Got it already."

"If thee understood then good."

With completely sleepy expression, Reiren nodded, oddly satisfied.
But for some reason instead of going back to her own bed, she was approaching in a direction of Kai's.

"Good, I shall sleep."

"What do you mean good!? This is my bed after all!"

"...Suya." _TL Note:_ this sound of sleep is just cute.

"Could it all be a sleep-talk...?"

"Ah! Hey, you, flat elf, move, move!
I'm the only one who can be close to Kai!"

The elf occupied the edge of the bed,
seeing that Rinne get up.

He was sandwiched between them.

"...Ah how I miss sharing room with Ashlan in the true world."

Kai took a big sigh from the bottom of his heart.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a href="#Part3" id="Part3" class="Bookmark"></a>

Stronghold Ruin S Fulham...

The fortress was surrounded by threefold mud wall with a ditch,
and at the time of enemy invasion they would set ditch on fire surrounding the fortress with the wall of fire,
which could act as defense.

"Probably even in Urza you've gathered intel from various hearsays,
but against spirits neither swords or guns are effective.
Their bodies are composed either of mist, light or viscous liquid!"

At the conference hall, on the fifth floor of the stronghold.
Lion King Balmnung's strong voice echoed throughout there.

"As for their weak point, these guys got core that holds magic power inside of their bodies.
While at least in theory it is possible to crush it with bullet or sword, but that's hard even for a skillful sniper.
Not to mention each has their core at a different place."

It required a miracle to shoot them.

When it comes to a enemy race against which guns were ineffective, first on the list would be cryptids with their firm scales that could reflect bullets,
but spirits were no less troublesome in other sense.

_TL TODO:_ First sentence is rephrased as I found it hard translate `火器全般`

"Effective weapons are these that can target the whole body.
You can quickly take care of the core by throughly burning the whole body using flames or bombs.
Like with this..."

_TL TODO:_ `ゴトン` what kind of sound?

Grenade <span title="Author uses jp. ガン i.e. gun, but we say launcher, right? ;)">launcher</span> was placed on the table with great a deal of noise.

Being able to toss around large sized gun, which was supposed to be held on both hands, by single hand was certainly a display of strength, befitting to the name of Lion King.

"It is loaded with incendiary rounds.
Here against wall you can see flamethrower.
Our Resistance is specialized in <span title="Original uses jp. 火力 which is literally flame/heat power, but I rephrased it">incendiary weaponry</span>,
even our tanks uses such ammunition."

"I see, though we're primary using machine guns..."

"But of course we already finished arrangements for your army.
We placed order to our weaponry production lines and our workers already organized mass production for you."

"You've been thorough. Allow me to express my gratitude, Balmnung-dono."

"Umu. That will be all then.
Prior to actual strategy planning we must make sure that you'll know all about Yurun's situatio and spirits' biology."

Giving a nod to the Jeanne with a serious look Lion King once again looked over people present.

The place where they held a meeting.
It was a banquet hall with desks and chairs lined up, once used by the kings,
now it was used by Jeanne's subordinates and Balmnung's subordinates

_TL TODO:_ This line is rather weird, re-work? `隊長級が勢揃いし、今朝はその顔合わせというわけだ。`

All commanding officers were present, hence this morning they held a introduction meeting.

_And here is also me._

_I hope Rinne and Reiren will keep quiet._

They disliked idea of sharing the room full of humans.

Both expressed the same sentiment and probably right now already out of the fortress, taking a walk through plains.

"Jeanne-dono, remain here.
Rest of you are free to start preparing for joint manoeuvres."

All soldiers stood up at once.

There was a strong sense of responsibility in eyes of these strong soldiers, which were leaving the room now.
Each of them carried a fighting spirit as if in response to commander Balmnung's instructions.

_Jeanne also gets respect from her soldiers._

_But this commander feels a bit like a senpai to his soldiers._

Lion King Balmnung.

This was a name that he didn't remember to hear in the true world.
And in this alternative world he was a distinguished figure, like Jeanne, who stood up in a time of mankind's crisis.

And now gaze of this man was...

"I've kept you waiting."

He turned towards the Kai who was sitting at the end of the room.

"Just yesterday I've invited Jeanne-dono to my room for a discussion.
At first I only intended it for one, maybe two hours talk, but unintentionally our discussion sprung.
For about five hours I guess?"

"Seven hours."

Faring interjected with a serious look.

"As you can see. This commander got scariest face in all of Yurun,
but if you look inside he is just like a young maiden.
Continuing chatting, forgetting about time, and turns out his hobby is a cooking.
On days off he would gather his subordinates to serve them some homemade dishes..."

"Farin."

"Oh, my bad."

Bearded man folds his arms and looks with amazement at female warrior who pretends to turn away in a shame.

"What I found particularly interesting in our talk with Jeanne-dono is that certain name popped out quite frequently during it.
Isn't that right, Jeanne-dono?"

"...Yeah. Well, around three of four times."

"Twenty eight times actually. According to my notes."

_TL Note:_ Oi, Jeanne, you might as well just admit it.

Lion King opens up a notebook which was filled with detailed notes.

It was a seven hours long talk.
Which left notebook with almost thirty pages of notes.

"Let us be honest here.
I already said that to Jeanne-dono, but under demons' domination Urza's situation was hopeless."

"..."

"There might be few smaller countries in addition to the four main ones, but among all of these
Urza is likely the region where humanity would be completely wiped out.
I've been already prepared for such outcome.
Considering the total territory that demons control and overall efforts of the Resistance."

Jeanne, together with Farin, remained silent.

Paying no attention to two of them, Lion King's gaze was constantly on Kai.

"And in such circumstances demons' hero has been crushed, allowing to turn <span title="situation">it</span> around.
Jeanne-dono would often mention your name when talking about the reason of the success."

He was side glancing.
Balmnung was looking towards the black bayonet, which was set by Kai's seat.

"As I heard it is rather strange weapon.
Bayonet... To me it looks as a rather old weapon, but mind if I take a look?"

In front of the Kai, who gave silent agreement, commander Balmnung took Drake Nail into his hands.

After carefully checking that it is not loaded with ammunition, he started at two triggers attached to a gun barrel.

"Normal bullets.
And another one is to blast explosive upon slash?"

"Yeah, correct."

He saw through Drake Nail's mechanism with a single glance...

As one would expected from naturally born soldier.
He was easily able to analyze the bayonet, that one could call a _futuristic_ weapon that doesn't exist in this world.

"I see, this is rather sophisticated."

Lion King made a hearty smile.

"I've made similar weaponry before, but this one is two generations ahead.
The blade itself is robust enough to withstand explosive blast...
Huh, well then I wonder if my engineers could reproduce it...
No, weight would be an issue..."

He lifted the Drake Nail with one hand.
While the other hand was going through his beard, he remained silent for more than a minute, carefully examining it.

"As Jeanne-dono mentioned, even to me with my long history as a soldier, seems that it incorporates unprecedented technology.
Hence I would like to hear about it in details."

"...That's..."

"I do not care about your origin.
There are already a lot of <span title="Funny enough original says 臑に傷 which literally means scars on leg, but it sounds kinda weird so I changed it a bit.">maimed</span> soldiers,
So I'm not planning to be picky when we don't have enough soldiers."

He held out the bayonet towards Kai's upper torso.

Kai considered the meaning behind Balmnung's manner of speech.

_So does he meant it?_

_Jeanne already talked about where me and Rinne is coming from._ _TL TOD:_ Re-check `ジャンヌはもう、俺やリンネが何処から来たのかを話してあると` it uses present time

It was likely because of demons' hero defeat.

Obviously such story is hard to swallow for the Resistance's commander.
So then how should he gain credibility?

It would be quicker to just show evidence that Kai is coming from so called the true world.

"So that's why drake nail...?"

"I'm only confident about your story for at most around 20%.
This bayonet is only a bare minimum evidence.
It is unlikely to be the key in defeating the demons' hero."

Balmnung's somewhat awkward expression maybe coming from his honest thought: [I'm not convinced yet.]

"So that's why I asked Jeanne-dono to let me talk with a person in question."

"Understood. Then what would you like to hear?"

"About <span title="spirits">them</span>."

With his jaw he pointed towards lots of documents on top of the desk.

Kai already went through it during the meeting, it was study of Yurun's Resistance battle records for last thirty years.

"The Great War had ended.
So does it mean spirits were defeated?"

"For certain."

"Then answer me.
What is their weakness?
What kind of forces and ammunition is necessary to destroy them.
Everything you know about their biology."

![Balmnung](./p149.jpg)

It was extremely direct.

"A history that I remember?"

"That's right."

"I'll start from conclusion:
I believe focus on military equipment is an correct approach.
My Drake Nail is a general purpose model, simply put it designed to be used against all four races.
Of course that includes spirits."

"With that two stage gunpowder?"

"Yes. For spirits you need [fire], without mistake.
Another thing is that there are no records of them appearing in extremely cold regions therefore they are considered weak against [cold]."

"Here it is warm, so rejected."

"That's it."

From battle records, there are no changes throughout a year when it comes spirits' raids in the Yurun.
Winter here is unable to weaken spirits' activity.

"Next is military strength.
Honestly I'm not sure how reliable it is."

"Reason being?"

"If we take Urza's example.
Battle between humans and spirits would depend on whether we're able to defeat spirits' hero."

That was the case in the true world.
As prophet Sid defeated Spirit Sovereign Rikugen Kyouko, he was able to put to the end conflict between races.

[All I'm saying is that I'm a being that grants a prophecy.]

[To grant you a meager <span title="jp. 言霊. See wikipedia article on Kotodama">power word</span>. Like once I did for the Sid.]

But...

It was indeed true that Kai never imagined that there would be someone behind the scene of the history to give Sid the prophecy.

_No, I should stop thinking about it right now._

_Unless you see [it] for yourself, there is no way you'd believe it._

"I'll ask you straight: is there a way to beat such monster?"

"According to known to me records Spirit Sovereign Rikugen Kyouko is described as
[ultimate type of <span title="jp. 原生生物 is sorta collection of micro organisms, see wikipedia">protist</span>]"

It was vicious slime creature.

While it does poses the core like other spirits, massive cells inside prevent bullets from reaching it.
And upon when sword slashes, it would be wrapped and caught inside of the slime body.

-Neither guns or swords are effective.

-Even if you blast it into pieces, they would quickly gather and regenerate.

It could go from human size to a size of the building.

"After burning Rikugen Kyouko's cells completely, we can destroy unprotected core.
But the main problem is..."

"Lack of firepower.
Yesterday, we came to the same conclusion."

Jeanne leaned against the wall.
With a thoughtful look, silver haired commander was just staring up at the ceiling.

"Balmnung-dono already ordered large scale weaponry at underground production plant.
But right now it is in a testing phase.
Mass production would take time, but it seems to be uncertain whether it would be enough for high ranking spirits."

"Yeah, honestly I think it is a rather difficult problem.
It is not a simple task to create large enough weapon that would be effective against high ranking spirits."

Humans of the true world also suffered from spirits.

When prophet Sid defeated Spirit Sovereign Rikugen Kyouko the power balance has been reversed,
until then they've be only on defensive.

Still...
They've been able to hold spirits' invasion on few fronts.

_You cannot beat high ranking spirits with ordinary firepower._

_To make up for lack of firepower a plan has been devised, If I'm not mistaken..._

"Commander Balmnung, did you attempt to traps?"

"Traps, you say?"

Lion King repeated Kai's word in a rather stern manner.

"Setting up multiple incendiary bombs to compensate for a lack of firepower?
It makes sense, but spirits appear out of nowhere.
There is no way to know where they would appear, so we cannot narrow it down if we want to set up a trap.
We need to compensate for a risk of concentrating our firepower."

"Not just a stationary trap, but rather a luring trap."

[Stationary trap] is the one that endlessly awaits enemy to touch it, like a land mine.

But the trap that Kai had in mind would be attracting spirits.

"There seems to be only battle records here."

While he was going through massive amount of documents.

"It is common to spirits to be attracted towards strong light or energy.
At least there are some records left that indicate so."

"...Tell me more."

"There are reports that spirits were gathering in large quantities when city was being burned down.
Similarly to insects and snakes, spirits for the most part rely on heat to detect their enemies."

Spirits bodies are composed of [light] or [mist] or [viscous liquid].

They only have single core which is magic organ, source of their power, there are no complicated organs like ears or eyes.
Therefore only magic organ is able to perceive heat - such was his thinking.

"How troublesome."

Yurun Resistance commander responded in a low voice.

"Gathering big fire is a rather weak basis.
I'm the commander.
Being entrusted with lives of my soldiers, it is my duty to make a solid grounds."

"I might have theory for a reason why they are migrating the nest."

"Hou?"

"They make their nest amids humans' ruins, but then suddenly move somewhere else.
This behavior makes my theory feasible.
When city is attacked, it also gets burned.
This fire lures them in and they crate their nest there.
But as time passes ruins are starting to cool down so..."

"I see. So they move aiming for a stronger source of light and heat."

Lion King closed his eyes partly.

He already understood it.
[stronger source of light and fire] are nothing else other than human cities where humans seek to hide.

Spirits are perceiving light and heat...
Which also serves as adequate explanation for a reason why they attack human cities.

"Apparently there are ruins that became a nest of spirits, just beyond the mountains in the northwest."

Farin stepped forward.

She walked towards the speaker's chair during the meeting and pointed on the map of the country, sicked to the wall.

The area controlled by spirits was painted by grey.

"The closest nest to this fortress would be there.
<span title="She uses here 司令官 rather than regular 指揮官 hence changed address, as it seems likely that she addresses him as she used when served here before">General</span>
Balmnung, how about we give a try to this one?"

"Not a light trap, but a spirit trap, huh?" _TL Note:_ This is a bit weirdly phrased, re-check `誘蛾灯ならぬ誘霊灯をか`

Balmnung fixed his gaze on the map.

"...It is worth to consider.
If we'd be able to lure them ourself, then it would make tactic of concentrating our firepower viable option."

"No, Balmnung-dono."

Placing hands on desk.
Light Knight Jeanne made a clear declaration.

"Let's not just consider, but do it."
