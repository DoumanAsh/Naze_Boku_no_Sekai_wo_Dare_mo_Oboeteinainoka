## Synopsis

“Why does no one remember the true world?!”

The era when the five great races were competing for hegemony ended with the victory of mankind led by the hero Sid.
However, that world was suddenly “overwritten” in front of a boy named Kai.
In the rewritten world Kai could see a result of mankind's defeat in great war due to absence of their hero Sid.
Now dragons and demons were dominating world, and Kay has been forgotten by all of mankind.
However, upon meeting the mysterious girl Rinne, Kay resolves to destroy the overwritten fate.
